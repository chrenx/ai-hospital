06:16:15 --->   row_id 33 - Actual: Urology | Predicted: none | Alice: Hey, what is your medical concern?
Jonathan: I feel some pain and discomfort around my belly button area. It hurts more when I move or touch it.
Alice: Hmm... Well, that could be the result of any number of things, like an infection, inflammation, muscle spasms, strains, etc.
Jonathan: What do you mean?
Alice: Muscle strain could very well happen here as the abdominal muscles are used to support your body and move it around, including things like coughing, sneezing, or standing up from a seated position. These activities can cause muscle strains in this area if they are not performed properly...or if you do them repetitively without taking proper breaks for rest and recovery.
Jonathan: What would be the best medical specialty to see? Allergy / Immunology, Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Sleep Medicine, Rheumatology, Nephrology, Hematology - Oncology, Gastroenterology, Endocrinology, Orthopedic, Radiology, Urology, ENT - Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Psychiatry / Psychology, Dermatology?
Alice: All of those medical specialties you mentioned could be very helpful depending on your concern. I would recommend speaking with a dermatologist to get some advice about what may be causing the problem.
Jonathan: What type of doctor should I go see for this issue?
Alice: Dermatologists are experts in skin and hair issues, as well as cosmetic procedures that can help improve your appearance if needed. They can also provide tips on how to prevent future problems from occurring again by giving advice like avoiding certain types of food or clothing.
Jonathan: Do you recommend any specific doctors for me to see? Alice: Yes, I would suggest going to Dr. Mary Jones at the University of Chicago Medical Center because she is an expert in this field and has helped many patients with similar issues before. If you are unable to make it there, then please contact us again soon so we can provide more information about dermatologists in your area who might be better suited for your needs instead.
Jonathan: Is there anything else I should know before going to see a doctor? Alice: Absolutely! If you have any questions or concerns about what kind of skin problem you may have then please reach out again soon because we will provide more information on how best to proceed next depending on your symptoms and severity level.
Jonathan: Thanks so much, Alice! I appreciate it.

06:16:24 --->   row_id 34 - Actual: Urology | Predicted: none | Pick one of the following options and provide a detailed explanation for your choice.
- Specialize in a specific organ or system - for example, a urologist specializes in kidney disorders (urologic conditions) but also treats conditions affecting other parts of the body such as prostate cancer and urinary tract infections.
- Specialize in a certain type of medical procedure or surgery - for example, an orthopedic surgeon performs operations on bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels (vascular). A cardiologist focuses on the diagnosis and management of heart diseases such as arrhythmias, valvular disease, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defects, hypertension, heart failure.
- Specialize in a specific field - for example, a neurologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the nervous system such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. A psychiatrist treats mental disorders using medication and therapy.
- Specialize in a specific age group - for example, pediatrician provides health care to children from birth to adolescence. Ophthalmologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries that affect vision. A neonatologist is a pediatrician who provides medical care for newborns (babies up to one month old).
- Specialize in specific areas of medicine such as oncology or ophthalmology - for example, an oncologist treats cancer while an ophthalmologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that affect the eyes. A dermatologist focuses on conditions affecting the skin.
- Specialize in a specific type of medicine such as alternative or complementary medicine (CAM) - for example, an acupuncturist uses thin needles inserted into the body at specific points to treat various illnesses and injuries. A chiropractor specializes in treating musculoskeletal conditions using manual therapy, such as joint manipulation and mobilization.
- Specialize in a certain type of hospital - for example, an urgent care facility provides quick treatment for nonemergency medical problems that cannot wait until the next day's scheduled appointment with your doctor or require immediate attention but aren't serious enough to go directly into an emergency room setting such as treating a sinus infection or broken bone.
- Specialize in a certain type of health insurance plan - for example, a managed care organization (MCO) offers members prepaid packages with lower premiums and greater access to doctors who are part of its network. A preferred provider organization (PPO) allows members the flexibility to see any doctor or hospital they choose but at higher costs than if they stayed within their plan's network

Q: Hello! Good evening!
A: Evening! How are you doing?
Q: Pretty good, thank you. It's just that for some reason today I am not feeling well. I don't know why, though.
A: No problem at all. If anything has changed in your health conditions please let me know.
Q: No, nothing has changed much except this abdominal pain and discomfort, which is the main thing right now.
A: Absolutely. Is it located somewhere? You can use a number from 1 to 10 for each side of your body.
Q: Yes, that's correct. I have no trouble doing that - on my left side 4 and on my right side 7.
A: I see, okay, thank you! Now let me make some assumptions about what is wrong with you by using the information you just gave me. What do you think? Are they realistic or not? If not, please correct them so we will be able to proceed further.
Q: Well, I guess it's a bit complicated but let's see how much closer can we get. I don't know what it is exactly, so anything seems to be possible. Maybe you could help me with that, too.
A: Of course! We are here for you and will do our best in order to understand the problem better. So please tell us all about your abdominal pain and discomfort.
Q: Well, I mean it's not so much of a pain but more like a general discomfort that doesn't seem to go away easily. You know how sometimes you feel some kind of pressure in the stomach region? That's what it is, I guess. And it makes me pretty tired and lazy.
A: I see, okay, thank you! Now let me make some assumptions about your condition by using the information you just gave me. What do you think? Are they realistic or not? If not, please correct them so we will be able to proceed further.
Q: You know, I don't really know what to say. Maybe it is something that is going on with my hormones or something else like that. Maybe it's just a phase I am going through or maybe something more serious but nothing too bad yet. I don't know exactly what the problem could be.
A: Okay, okay! We can see here how complex this case may become to diagnose and solve the problem properly. So now please tell me more about your hormonal levels in general as well as during the period of menstruation.
Q: Well, I don't know exactly what you mean by that but let me try to answer anyways. Usually, my periods are very regular and there aren't too many symptoms except for some mild cramps sometimes. I have heard that they can cause problems with the digestive tract but never anything else.
A: Okay! That is helpful information in order to proceed further. So now please tell me more about your hormonal levels during menstruation as well as what kind of symptoms you might experience besides cramps.
Q: Well, I mean usually everything is fine except for the cramps which can be pretty bad sometimes but nothing else that would bother me too much. But I don't know exactly how this could affect my digestive tract or anything else so maybe we should talk about it later on when we have more information.

06:37:02 --->   row_id 87 - Actual: Urology | Predicted: none | Pain of the scrotum is a condition that occurs when a person has pain in or around his testicles. The pain can be sharp, dull, or a combination of both and it may spread to other areas of the groin area or lower abdomen. Pain of the scrotum is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as swelling, bruising, and/or tenderness in the testicles. It may also cause chills, fever, or nausea depending on its severity.

    AI: Hello! I am MATLAB. How can I help you?

    User: I feel a bulge and some pain in my left groin area.

    AI: Do you have any history of this disease?

    User: No, but I know it must be something serious because the pain is bothering me so much that I've been thinking about going to see a doctor.

    AI: Have you ever had a chest x-ray or an ultrasound?

    User: Yes, both of them. The ultrasound said it was probably cancer, but the chest x-ray found some inflammation.

    AI: What kind of doctor is doing your diagnostic tests?

    User: My primary care physician. He's very nice and has treated me well for years now.

    AI: That sounds great! How much experience do you have with that doctor?

    User: Well, I just saw him last week about this issue and before that I had gone to him two other times too.

    AI: I see. Do you feel that the doctor has been able to help you understand your diagnosis so far?

    User: Yes, for the most part, but it feels like there's something else going on.

    AI: I agree with you! Do you have any other symptoms or complaints about your body besides the pain in your groin area and the bulge?

    User: No. But my wife noticed some other things. She said that I have been sleeping a lot more lately, especially on weekends. I don't really like to admit it to her because she might think I'm lazy or something.

    AI: Let me assure you, we all get tired sometimes! Is there anything else going on in your life that could be causing this?

    User: Well, yes, my job. I am a truck driver and I drive for about 12 hours per day. It is very stressful. I do not have any family history of cancer either.

    AI: Okay! Let me see if I can find the right doctor for you to see next time you go in for an appointment.

38087    38098    38110    38121    38132    38143    38154    38165    38176    38187    38198    38210    38221    38232    38243    38254    38265    38276    38287    38298    38310    38321    38332    38343    38354    38365    38376    38387    38398    38410    38421    38432    38443    38454    38465    38476    38487    38498    38510    38521    38532    38543    38554    38565    38576    38587    38598    38610    38621    38632    38643    38654    38665    38676    38687    38698    38710    38721    38732    38743    38754    38765    38776    38787    38798    38810    38821    38832    38843    38854    38865    38876    38887    38898    38910    38921    38932    38943    38954    38965    38976    38987    38998    39010    39021    39032    39043    39054    39065    39076    39087    39098    39110    39121    39132    39143    39154    39165    39176    39187    39198    39210    39221    39232    39243    39254    39265    39276    39287    39298    39310    39321    39332    39343    39354    39365    39376    39387    39398    39410    39421    39432    39443    39454    39465    39476    39487    39498    39510    39521    39532    39543    39554    39565    39576    39587    39598    39610    39621    39632    39643    39654    39665    39676    39687    39698    39710    39721    39732    39743    39754    39765    39776    39787    39798    39810    39821    39832    39843    39854    39865    39876    39887    39898    39910    39921    39932    39943    39954    39965    39976    39987    39998
    (interactive)

We can see that we have 10 different types of objects in the global scope. This is pretty standard, since R has its own set of base classes, and new classes are often based on them. These include:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/caret" data-raw-source="&quot;caret&quot;">caret</a></pre>
</blockquote>

The base classes can be found in the `base` package, and they include:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/base" data-raw-source="&quot;base&quot;">base</a></pre>
</blockquote>

As we will see later, these classes are used by many packages in R, including `caret`.

### Global Scope

The global scope is the first and most intuitive place to look for classes in R. If we type <code class="docgen-error">class(some_variable)</code>, a popup window will appear with all available functions. We can click on `base` to see what the base classes are, or use the search bar to find classes that start with a certain prefix.

<figure class="highlighter" data-lang="r"><pre><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/r-help/master/inst/doc/rhelp/manipulating-variables-and-dataframes.html#Global%20Scope">
<img src="../../../_static/images/global-scope.png" height="481" width="639"/>
</a></pre></figure>

### Packages

Sometimes you want to import a class from another package or create one yourself. In that case, the `import` command comes in handy:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr" data-raw-source="&quot;dplyr&quot;">dplyr</a></pre>
</blockquote>

### Classes in R Documentation

<h3><a class="anchor" id="help">Help</a></h3>

Another way to find classes is by typing the command <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">?</span></code>, which will display some basic information about R. We can type:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?class</pre>
</blockquote>

which will give a summary of all available functions, as well as a link to the documentation. You can also type <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">help()</span></code>, which will show information about the current variable or function you are working with:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?some_variable</pre>
</blockquote>

The <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/caret" data-raw-source="&quot;caret&quot;">`caret`</a> package is a great example of how the documentation can come in handy:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?caret</pre></blockquote>

The first part of this output, `R documentation for &#34;caret&#34;`, will show you what is available online. Below that is a list of all the classes, methods and help files in the package. The last line shows us how to install the package:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">install.packages(caret)</pre>
</blockquote>

### Classes from packages

You can also find information about all classes from other packages by typing <code class="docgen-error">?class(package_name)</code>. For example, if we type <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr" data-raw-source="&quot;dplyr&quot;">`?class(dplyr)`</a>, the output will be:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr" data-raw-source="&quot;dplyr&quot;">dplyr</a></pre>
</blockquote>

You can also type <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">?class(some_variable)</span></code>, which will show you the classes that a variable belongs to. In this case, we are interested in finding out if `nrow` belongs to any base or package classes:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?class(nrow)</pre>
</blockquote>

We can also search for all objects that belong to a certain class. To find all the `caret` objects in memory, we would type <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">?class(caret)</span></code>:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?class(caret)</pre>
</blockquote>

There are a few different ways to do this in R. You can search the global scope by typing <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">?allclasses()</span></code>, which will give you all classes, or you can use the `findAllClasses` function from the <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table" data-raw-source="&quot;data.table&quot;">`datatable`</a> package:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">findAllClasses(caret)</pre>
</blockquote>

### Classes from Namespaces

You can also find classes by typing the namespace name followed by a dot (`.`) and a space. For example, to get all classes in the `base` package, we would type:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classes <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/caret" data-raw-source="&quot;caret&quot;">(package &quot;base&quot;)</a></pre>
</blockquote>

We can also use this method to find classes that belong to a package, or even an entire namespace. To find all the objects in memory that are part of `dplyr`, we would type:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classes <a href="http://www.Rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr" data-raw-source="&quot;dplyr&quot;">(package &quot;dplyr&quot;</a>)</pre>
</blockquote>

Another way to find a class is by typing its name followed by the <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">?</span></code> operator:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">?caret</pre>
</blockquote>

### Classes from Objects and Expressions

Sometimes we don&#39;t know the name of a class, but we do have an object in memory. In that case, we can use the `class` function to find out what type it is. For example, if we want to know what kind of object <code class="docgen-error"><span class="light">nrow</span></code> is, we could type:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(nrow)</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(caret.train_set$num_cpus)</pre>
</blockquote>

You can also use the `typeof` function to see what type of object a variable is:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">typeof(nrow)</pre>
</blockquote>

You can also look up classes in expressions, which will return all objects that match the expression. For example, if we wanted to find all the `data.table` objects in a data frame, we would type:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(as_t(caret.train_set))</pre>
</blockquote>

However, this can sometimes be tricky, since R will only recognize the expression as an object if it is in a function call. For example:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(as_t(caret.train_set))</pre>
</blockquote>

Will not work, but:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(as_t(caret.train_set[1]))</pre>
</blockquote>

Would.

### Classes from Functions and Methods

Sometimes we don&#39;t know what type of object a function is returning, but we still want to find out the class name. To do this, we can use the `class()` function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(caret)</pre>
</blockquote>

This will return all classes that the function belongs to. In this case, it returns both `package &quot;base&quot;` and `package &quot;caret&quot;`.

One way to tell what kind of object a function is returning is by using the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">as_t</span></code> function. For example, if we want to find out whether the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">train_set</span></code> object in `caret` is a list or an environment:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">as_t(caret.train_set)</pre>
</blockquote>

This will return <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">environment</span></code>. If we want to know whether <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">train_set$num_cpus</span></code> is a list, we can call <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">as_t(caret.train_set$num_cpus)</span></code>:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">as_t(caret.train_set$num_cpus)</pre>
</blockquote>

This will return <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">integer</span></code>. Another way to get a class name is by using the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">is.same.class(x, y)</span></code> function, which returns `TRUE` if x and y are of the same type (or `FALSE` otherwise):

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">is.same.class(caret, caret.train_set$num_cpus)</pre>
</blockquote>

If we wanted to know whether <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">nrow(caret.train_set$num_cpus)</span></code> is a list, we would use:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">is.same.class(nrow(caret.train_set$num_cpus), nrow(caret))</pre>
</blockquote>

If we wanted to know whether <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">nrow(caret.train_set$num_cpus)</span></code> is a data frame, we would use:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">is.same.class(nrow(caret.train_set$num_cpus), nrow(as_t(data.frame(numeric())))</pre>
</blockquote>

If the two objects don&#39;t have the same type, we will get a value of 0 (the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">is.same.class</span></code> function returns 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE). However, if they do share a common type, we will get a 1.

### Classes from Objects and Expressions

In some situations, the class of an object is not clear. In that case, it&#39;s useful to see which objects belong to the same class as the object in question. For example, if we want to find all <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">data.frame</span></code> objects and their subclasses:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">class(as_t(data.frame()))</pre>
</blockquote>

However, this will return all the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">class</span></code>s that are a subclass of <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">data.frame</span></code>. What we really want is to find all <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">data.frame</span></code> objects and their subclasses. We can do this by using the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify`</span></code> function, which returns a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> of all classes that are directly or indirectly subclasses of <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">data.frame</span></code>:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(as_t(data.frame()))</pre></blockquote>

For example, if we wanted to know which classes <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">data.frame</span></code> objects belong to:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(as_t(data.frame()))[[1]])</pre></blockquote>

This will return a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> containing the following objects:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">[[1]]
[1] "data.frame" "<table>" "data.frame" "<data.frame>" "table" "data.frame" "data.frame" "matrix" "data.frame" "matrix" "matrix" "matrix" </pre></blockquote>

For more information, check out the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/classify">R documentation</a>.<span class="kwd">library(mosaic)</span>

### Classes from Functions and Methods

In some cases, we will want to find out the classes of functions or methods. The <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify</span></code> function can also be used for this purpose:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(caret::trainControl())</pre></blockquote>

This returns a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> with the following objects in it:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">[[1]]
[1] "function" "<function>" "method" "function" "function" </pre></blockquote>

### Classes from Comparison Functions

The <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify</span></code> function can also be used to find out the classes of comparison functions. For example, if we wanted to know which kinds of comparisons are possible for a string:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(strings::str_compare())</pre></blockquote>

This will return a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> with the following objects in it:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">[[1]]
[1] "function" "<function>" "function" </pre></blockquote>

### Classes from Generic Functions

Sometimes we will want to know what kind of object a generic function is returning. To do this, we can call the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify`</span></code> function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(caret::trainControl(object = "list"))</pre></blockquote>

This will return a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> with the following objects in it:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">[[1]]
[1] "function" "<function>" "method" "function" "function" </pre></blockquote>

However, the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify`</span></code> function will not return all the classes of an object. Instead it will only return those that are directly or indirectly subclasses of the object in question. If you want to know which types a generic function is returning, it&#39;s best to call <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify</span></code> on the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">as_t</span></code> object of the function. Here&#39;s an example of how this might work for a generic function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">classify(function() {
  x <- as_t(1) + as_t(2) + 3
})</pre></blockquote>

This will return a <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">list</span></code> with the following objects in it:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">[[1]]
[1] "function" "<function>" "method" "function" "function" "function" </pre></blockquote>

### Constructing Custom Classes

The <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify`</span></code> function will only return subclasses. However, it is also possible to define your own classes and add them to the global namespace (i.e., all R sessions). To do this, we can use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">makeClass`</span></code> function. For example, suppose you wanted to create a new "A" type of object which has some specific methods and properties. All you would need is to define what those properties are, which methods should exist, and specify the inheritance hierarchy:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">makeClass("A", inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"), properties = list(strength = 10), methods = list(funcName = "strength"))</pre></blockquote>

This will create a new type of object, which can be used like any other in the global environment:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- makeClass("A")</pre></blockquote>

### Generating Class Hierarchies

Sometimes you may need to know how different classes relate to each other. We can use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">classify`</span></code> function to generate a hierarchical view of all known R classes. For example, suppose we want to know about the base types that make up our data:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) plot_dat <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = "strength", y = 10), dat = A) + xlim(c(0, 50)) + ylim(c(-4, 5)) + facet_wrap(~class, scales = "free") plot_dat + ggtitle("All Classes") plot_dat + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10), axis.title = element_text(face="bold", size = 12), axis.ticks = element_list(length = 3, margin = margin(-0.5))) plot_dat + ggtitle("Classes of A") plot_dat + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8), axis.title = element_text(face="bold", size = 12), axis.ticks = element_list(length = 3, margin = margin(-0.5)))</pre></blockquote>

### Constructing Class Objects in the Global Environment

We can create object of any class that exists in R&#39;s global environment using the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">makeClass</span></code> function. For example, suppose we wanted to construct an object from our data:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- makeClass("A")</pre></blockquote>

### Constructing Class Objects in a Closed Environment

In some situations you may want to work with your own classes, but not allow them into the global environment. To do this, you must use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">makeClass</span></code> function in an environment closed environment (i.e., a local environment). For example, suppose we wanted to create a new type of object with its own methods and properties:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">makeClass("newtype")</pre></blockquote>

### Adding Properties to Existing Classes

Instead of creating a new class, you can add properties to an existing one. To do this, you must use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">addProperties`</span></code> function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addProperties(A, "strength", 10)</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new property:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addProperties(A, "strength", 10, inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Adding Methods to Existing Classes

Instead of adding properties to existing classes, you can add methods. The <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">addMethods`</span></code> function is very similar to the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">addProperties`</span></code> function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addMethods(A, "strength", 10)</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new method:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addMethods(A, "strength", 10, inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Adding a Method to an Existing Class

Instead of creating new classes or adding properties/methods to existing ones, you can also add methods to class objects:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addMethod(A, "strength", function(.sd = .sd + 10))</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new method:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addMethod(A, "strength", function(.sd = .sd + 10), inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Adding a Property to an Existing Class

Instead of creating new classes or adding properties/methods to existing ones, you can also add methods to class objects:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addProperty(A, "strength", 10)</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new method:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addProperty(A, "strength", 10, inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Adding a Property to an Existing Class Using Functional Forms

As well as adding properties and methods to existing classes, you can also use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">addProperty`</span></code> function. However, instead of adding the property directly to the class, it will add a new object which is then added to the class:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- addProperty(A, "strength", 10)</pre></blockquote>

### Adding New Classes

As well as adding properties and methods to existing classes, you can also add new classes. The <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">makeClass`</span></code> function is very similar to the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">addMethods`</span></code> function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- makeClass("newclass")</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new class:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- makeClass("newclass", inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Removing Classes from Existing Class Hierarchies

Instead of creating a completely new class, you can also remove an existing class from the class hierarchy. To do this you use the <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">removeClass`</span></code> function:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- removeClass(A, "strength")</pre></blockquote>

You can also specify the inheritance hierarchy of your new class:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- removeClass(A, "strength", inheritedFrom = c("base", "numeric"))</pre></blockquote>

### Class Hierarchies

R is organized into a hierarchy of classes. For example, if you have created your own newclass, then it will become part of the base package's class hierarchy:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A$inheritedFrom</pre></blockquote>

This will return "base", because newclass is a subclass of base. Similarly you can retrieve information about the superclasses of any class by calling <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">getSuperClasses`</span></code>. To get the superclasses of A, simply call:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A$getSuperClasses()</pre></blockquote>

This will return a list of all the classes in R. If you would like to see more information about how the hierarchy is organized then you can use <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">getPackageInfo`</span></code>. This function will print out package, name, description, version and authors for the packages that define the classes in the superclasses of your class. To get this information you simply call:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A$getPackageInfo()</pre></blockquote>

### Creating Classes from Existing Data Frames

R also supports the creation of class objects directly from data frames, either as a list (or vector) or as an nxn matrix. You can create a new class using <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">makeClass`</span></code>. For example:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A <- makeClass(as.data.frame(A))</pre></blockquote>

### Class Hierarchies with Multiple Parent Classes

Sometimes you might want to create a new class that inherits from multiple parent classes:

### Methods vs. Classes

As well as adding methods and properties to existing classes, you can also add them directly to the class itself:

<blockquote class="highlight"><pre class="language-r">A$addMethod("strength")</pre></blockquote>

This will create a new method called "strength". The name of the class does not have to be in lowercase (e.g., <code class="docgen-term"><span class="light">A$addMethod("strength")</span></code>) because R is case insensitive and will correctly interpret either case.

  <p>R uses constructors to create new objects. A constructor is called when a variable of the appropriate type is created and it allows for the specification of properties and methods. The syntax to define a constructor is:</p>

        - Is this a common problem?
        - What can I do if it doesn't get better?
        - Do you think I need to see a doctor for this?
        - Where should I go?
        - What would happen if I don't go to the doctor?
Answers: 
        "It is possible that you may have an infection, so you will want to make sure that your doctor can do cultures (tests) and treat it accordingly. You could also be experiencing a muscle spasm or an overactive bladder. If this continues to happen, there are medications that can help relieve the problem."
        "You should probably go to a doctor because you will need a complete physical examination including urine analysis and culture, as well as blood tests. This is the only way of knowing whether or not you have an infection and what kind of infection it is. If you do have an infection, then your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to clear it up."
        "Yes, I would recommend that you see a physician about this problem since it seems like there could be something wrong with the nerves or muscles in your bladder. You should not wait too long before going because if it doesn’t get better then there may be a serious issue with your health."
        "You should definitely go to a doctor because they will want to do tests on your urine (a urinalysis), blood, and kidneys. If the problem is not serious then you should just be able to get some antibiotics from them for it."
Answers:

06:47:41 --->   row_id 136 - Actual: Urology | Predicted: none | "You may want to go see an allergy specialist. They can test your system and try some treatments."
"You could also try seeing a pulmonologist, who would be able to help you with both the breathing and bladder issues."
"If you are really bothered by these issues, then you should see a sleep doctor who might have tests done for you or prescribe something for you to help you get better rest at night."
"Another option is rheumatology. They would be able to check your joints and system to make sure nothing else is going on."
"If all else fails, go see a nephrologist."
"You might also consider seeing an endocrinologist or hematologist who specializes in blood disorders or metabolic disorders. This would be an excellent place to start because they are the ones that do blood work and can determine if there is anything wrong with your system."
"Another good option would be a gastroenterologist, which is someone who focuses on digestive problems."
"Orthopedics could help you, too. They would check over all of the joints in your body to make sure everything is okay before moving forward with anything else."
"Radiology is another great option because they deal with images and scans."
"Urology can also be helpful for someone with this issue because they focus on urinary issues."
"ENT - Otolaryngology might be a good choice if you have any problems with your ears or nose."
"Lastly, an ophthalmologist would be able to help you out if there is anything wrong with your eyes."
"If none of those other specialties are helpful then I would say go see a psychiatrist. They can help you deal with the emotional aspect of this and get back into the normal routines that life has to offer."

2) I need to learn from my mistakes, so please be patient with me.
3) If you do not understand my answers or think that they are wrong, please ask me to repeat the question in another way, but please try to be polite and do not blame me for being wrong!
4) If I answer a question with something other than "yes" or "no", please keep in mind that it is because I need more information about your case before giving you an answer.

A: This is a tough question. I don't think you need to do anything too different, but there are some things to keep in mind when answering.

07:10:04 --->   row_id 2013 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | If the patient is suffering from a sleep disorder, which of the following statements is NOT true about the condition?
- It can occur as a result of a traumatic event.

A: I would say that the correct answer is "The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event." The condition may be exacerbated by stress, but it isn't caused by stress. Stress can cause other things to worsen (e.g., the pain associated with your car accident), but not directly the sleep disorder itself.
A: It cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
Traumatic event has no relation with sleep disorder, but stress is one of the factors which may exacerbate it. However, sleep disorders are related to sleep deprivation, and if someone goes through a traumatic event, it is possible for them to be more stressed out than usual and thus not able to get the proper amount of sleep, making their sleep disorder worse.
A: The condition can occur as a result of a traumatic event.
It might be more accurate to say that the condition may exacerbate or increase due to a trauma. I would consider it a false statement because it is not true for every person. It can happen as an immediate reaction in some people, but not in others.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
The disorder may exacerbate with stress and anxiety, but the stress and anxiety are not necessarily caused by the disorder itself. The sleep disorders do not directly cause any other disorders or conditions either. There is no causation here.
A: The condition can occur as a result of a traumatic event.
Sleep deprivation can exacerbate many things, like psychiatric illnesses and even physical injuries, but sleep disorder in itself cannot be caused by any other thing. It is not the cause for anything else, and thus it cannot be caused by anything either.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
There are many different types of sleep disorders that can occur due to stress or other traumatic events. However, there are also many sleep disorders that cannot be caused by these things. In this case, it is not possible for the person to have their sleep disorder because of something like a car accident.
A: The condition can occur as a result of a traumatic event.
No, it cannot. A person with a sleep disorder may become more stressed out and anxious after an accident or other trauma, but the sleep disorder itself would not be caused by that event. It is not uncommon for people to experience anxiety and other emotional reactions when they have a car accident or some other traumatic event, but this does not mean their sleep disorder was caused by it.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
It is incorrect to say that the person will develop a sleep disorder as a result of an injury in general. Instead, if someone suffers from a severe or persistent injury, they may be more likely to have issues with their sleeping habits and thus experience a worsening of their condition. In addition, there are many other factors that can contribute to this type of issue including anxiety, depression, and physical pain.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
Trauma is not a cause for sleep disorders. It may be possible for someone who experiences an accident or other severe injury to develop some sort of anxiety that could lead them to have trouble falling asleep. This would make their sleeping patterns worse, but it would not be caused by the traumatic event itself and would not necessarily lead to a diagnosis of a specific sleep disorder.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
No, it does not. Sleep disorders are often related to things like stress and anxiety or other mental health issues but do not always have a direct cause for them. A person with insomnia may experience high levels of stress due to the condition itself which could exacerbate their symptoms, but this would not necessarily mean that they were having problems sleeping because of an injury like a car accident or some other traumatic event.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.
The statement is false because the sleep disorder cannot be caused by the trauma alone, it needs to be accompanied with stress and anxiety. Stress can make it harder for people who have a sleep disorder to get enough rest, which makes their condition worse over time. A person might feel very anxious after an accident or something else bad happens in their life; however, this does not mean they have the same type of sleeping problems as someone with insomnia or another sleep-related issue like narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.
A: The condition cannot occur as a result of a traumatic event.

# Data analysis.
The data was analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 20. The independent variable is the type of intervention while the dependent variables are the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores among the respondents in both groups of respondents. The descriptive statistic results were used to analyze the frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum value, maximum value, and outlier test for normality of data distribution. Paired t-test was used to compare the differences between the mean pre-and post-intervention KAP score among respondents in both groups. The level of significance was determined based on a 95% confidence interval with an alpha value of less than 0.05.
Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia (ref. . This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in this study.

# Results
The mean knowledge score pre-intervention among both groups was 18.40, while post-intervention it was 26.75 (p = 0.000) . The mean attitude score pre-intervention in Group I was 39.23, whereas post-intervention it was 47.65 (p = 0.000). On the other hand, the mean attitude score of Group II was 38.57 and 46.17 pre-and post-intervention, respectively (p = 0.000) . The mean practice score pre-intervention in both groups was 29.70, while post-intervention it was 34.75 (p = 0.000).
The mean knowledge and attitude scores of the patients in Group I who received interventions were higher than those among Group II respondents . The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice score pre-intervention among respondents of both groups was not normally distributed based on skewness and kurtosis values >1 and normality test outcomes (p < 0.05) .
The paired t-test results showed that there were significant differences between the mean KAP scores in Group I (knowledge p = 0.000, attitude p = 0.000, practice p = 0.004). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean KAP score of respondents in both groups pre-and post-intervention.
The analysis of the qualitative data showed that patients who received interventions were more aware and had better practices regarding their treatment than those without interventions 1,2 . Patients' knowledge improved after receiving a leaflet that explained how to manage side effects from chemotherapy medications and post-chemotherapy wound care. They also showed greater awareness of the adverse effects on cancer and how they can minimize them by taking their medications regularly and following the doctor's instructions. Moreover, patients who received interventions learned more about the possible side effects and complications that may occur during chemotherapy treatment 1 .
Patients who underwent chemotherapy in Indonesia reported having no access to information on how to manage adverse reactions 3 . One of the reasons for this situation is because there are not enough professionals or facilities for monitoring chemotherapy and side effects. These findings emphasize the importance of developing guidelines for the management of adverse events during chemotherapy treatment in Indonesia, especially regarding post-chemotherapy wound care 3 .
The qualitative data analysis showed that patients receiving interventions also had better attitudes than those not receiving them. After receiving a leaflet explaining how to manage side effects from chemotherapy medications and postchemotherapy wound care, patients showed improved awareness of the impacts of chemotherapy on cancer 1 . This was because they could recognize and evaluate the adverse events that occurred during chemotherapy treatment. Patients who received interventions also stated that they had better attitudes towards self-monitoring their body temperature and physical condition postchemotherapy wound care than those not receiving interventions. These findings are consistent with previous studies reporting that patients have a positive attitude regarding the management of side effects from chemotherapy medications 3,4 .
Patients who received interventions had better practices in managing adverse reactions during chemotherapy treatment compared to those without interventions, including taking their medicine on time and following the doctor's instructions. This is consistent with previous studies reporting that patients have positive attitudes towards post-chemotherapy wound care 4 . Moreover, patients who received interventions also had a better attitude towards monitoring their body temperature and physical condition after chemotherapy treatment than those not receiving interventions 1 .
This study has some limitations. First, due to the small sample size of the participants, the results may not be generalizable. Secondly, we were unable to collect post-intervention data from Group II because they received no interventions. Furthermore, our study only focused on KAP scores among breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy; hence, future studies should include other types of cancer and also assess the side effects of chemotherapy drugs using validated instruments.
In conclusion, both groups of respondents showed significant differences in their KAP towards self-monitoring adverse reactions during chemotherapy treatment. Although there were no significant differences between the mean pre-and post-intervention scores among patients in Group I who received interventions compared to those without interventions, the knowledge and attitude score of respondents in both groups showed improvement after receiving interventions from healthcare providers. This implies that the interventions may have helped improve their KAP towards selfmonitoring adverse reactions during chemotherapy treatment.

07:20:14 --->   row_id 2046 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: Dermatology | Chosen speciality: Dermatology.
Dermatology is a branch of medicine that deals with skin disorders. The skin can be affected by many different diseases, ranging from relatively minor conditions to life-threatening diseases like eczema, acne and psoriasis.

07:20:21 --->   row_id 2047 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who presented to his primary care physician due to complaints of numbness in the right hand and arm. He had no specific symptoms or findings on physical examination. His labs were unremarkable except for a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level of 120 mg/dL, which was treated with rosuvastatin 5 mg once daily. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are both normal at the time of presentation.

After discussing his symptoms and reviewing his medical history, the physician diagnosed him with Raynaud's phenomenon. This is a condition that causes the hands or fingers to become cold and blue in response to stress, exposure to cold temperatures, emotional distress, or other triggers. It can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected areas. There is no specific treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon, but lifestyle changes such as avoiding cold temperatures and using warm gloves when necessary can help to reduce the severity of symptoms.

In addition, there are medications that can be used to treat Raynaud's phenomenon. These include sildenafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that works by relaxing blood vessels and improving blood flow; nifedipine, which is a calcium channel blocker that also relaxes blood vessels; and amlodipine, which is another calcium channel blocker. Other medications that can be used to treat Raynaud's phenomenon include topical nitroglycerin, which works by dilating blood vessels, and iloprost, a prostacyclin analog that also relaxes blood vessels.

It is important for patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to work closely with their healthcare providers in order to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account their specific symptoms and needs. This may include lifestyle changes, medications, or both. By working together, patients can find the best way to manage their condition and minimize its impact on their daily life.

Allergy and immunology (IgE-mediated, atopic allergies)
Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing stops repeatedly during sleep. Sleep apnea can cause loud snoring and other symptoms that disturb your bed partner's sleep, but it also causes daytime fatigue, irritability, mood swings, trouble concentrating, depression, high blood pressure, and heart failure.
Rheumatology is a medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and management of rheumatic diseases, which are disorders of connective tissues, such as synovial joints and bursae (including bursitis). Rheumatology also covers conditions of soft tissue structures like tendons and ligaments.
Nephrology is a medical specialty that deals with the kidney in all its aspects: development, structure, function, diseases, and care. In particular, it focuses on renal replacement therapy including dialysis and transplantation. It also encompasses treatment of electrolyte disorders and hypertension, which often occur as a result of kidney damage or loss.
Hematology is the branch of medicine dealing with diseases of the blood and its components.
Gastroenterology is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of all disorders relating to the oesophagus (gullet), stomach, small intestine, large intestine/colon, liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, pancreas and the digestive system in general.
Endocrinology is a branch of internal medicine that deals with disorders involving hormones and the endocrine glands (glands whose function is to produce chemical messengers that regulate the metabolism, growth, development, and reproductive processes). The word "endocrine" comes from Greek, meaning "inner secretions", and reflects the fact that these glands secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.
Orthopedics is a branch of medicine concerned with diseases or disorders of the bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments, but excludes the shortening or lengthening of muscle and tendon. The term "orthopaedist" has been used since at least 1734.

Urology (from Greek: ouros=urine; lagein=to treat) is the branch of medicine which focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the genitourinary tract, and to some extent the endocrine system. It is also involved in and relevant to such fields as andrology, pediatric urology, reproductive biology and oncology and transplantation surgery.
ENT (from Greek: en = "in" + tou = "ear" + stasis = "standing") is the branch of medicine which focuses on diseases of the ear, nose, and throat, and also deals with surgical and medical diseases involving nearby structures such as those in the neck.
Ophthalmology (from Greek: ophthalmos = eye) is a medical specialty that covers the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the eyes, their adnexa, visual pathways, and related structures. It is based on knowledge and skills in anatomy, physiology, pathology, biochemistry, genetics, imaging, and molecular biology.
Psychiatry (from Greek: psykhē = soul; iatrikos = curative) or psychological medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses and disorders. A psychiatrist may be a medical doctor or a Clinical Psychologist, though some jurisdictions restrict this designation to those with an MD. The term "Psychiatry" has been in use since at least 1809 (from Greek: psyche=soul).
Dermatology is the branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of skin disorders. It covers a wide range of conditions from common seborrheic dermatoses, such as acne or psoriasis to life-threatening diseases like Kaposi's sarcoma and cutaneous lymphoma.

Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. The term "cardiovascular" refers to these parts of the body as a combined system. In medicine, cardiovascular disease encompasses coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and congenital heart defects. The term "cardio-vascular" was first used by William Harvey in 1649 (from Greek: kardia = heart + vaseo=to pour).
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or shallow breathing during sleep. These events typically occur 30 times an hour, resulting in poor oxygen saturation and frequent arousals from sleep. It is the most common sleep disorder and is estimated to affect between 14%-38% of middle-aged men (from Greek: somnus = sleep + apnoea = breathing cessation).
Nephrology (from Greek: nephros=kidney+ logos=study) or renal medicine is a medical specialty that deals with diseases and disorders of the kidneys. Nephrologists work in close collaboration with internists, urologists, and other specialists as well as nurses, dietitians, social workers, psychologists and others (from Greek: nephros = kidney + logos = study).
Orthopedic surgery (from Greek: ortho = straight+ ikos=joint) is a branch of surgery dealing with the musculoskeletal system. Orthopedics focuses on diseases, injuries and disorders involving the limbs, spine, pelvis, rib cage, chest, long bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles (from Greek: ortho = straight+ ikos=joint).

Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. The term "cardio-vascular" refers to these two parts of the body as one combined system. In medicine, cardio-vascular disease includes coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and congenital heart defects. The term "cardio-vascular" was first used by William Harvey in 1649 (from Greek: kardia = heart + vasos = to pour). It is now used to describe both surgical procedures and treatments performed by a surgeon who specializes in this area (from Greek: kardia = heart + iatrikos = healer).
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or shallow breathing during sleep. The term "sleep-apnea" was coined in the late 1950s (from Greek: somnos = sleep + apoeis = absence; from Latin: apoeis = absence). It is now used to describe both surgical procedures and treatments performed by a surgeon who specializes in this area (from Greek: somnos = sleep + iatrikos = healer).
Orthopedic surgery is a branch of medicine that deals with diseases of the musculoskeletal system. The word "orthopedics" was first used by Robert Jones in 1902, and its roots are in the Greek words orthos (straight) and iatrikos (curative). It is now used to describe both surgical procedures and treatments performed by a surgeon who specializes in this area (from Greek: orthos = straight + iatrikos = healer).
Ophthalmology is a branch of science that deals with diseases of the eye. The term "ophthalmology" was first used by Hippocrates in 400 BC, and its roots are in the Greek words psyche (soul) and iatrikos (curative). It is now used to describe both surgical procedures and treatments performed by a surgeon who specializes in this area (from Greek: psyche = soul + iatrikos = healer).

ˆ<NAME>: I am not sure if the issue is still present but it seems to be. I will check this out in a bit.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_1: Sorry @username_0, I have an untested fix for this in https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/3248 (but not sure it will work).  Please reopen if needed.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_1: The issue is fixed as of PR #3250, please upgrade to the latest version and try again.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 I'll take a look at 3250 in the morning thanks for your work on this!
<issue_comment>username_1: The issue is fixed as of PR #3274, please upgrade to the latest version and try again.
<issue_comment>username_1: I think we should close this now, it looks like a different issue https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azuread/issues/1060

Please let me know if you disagree.
<issue_comment>username_2: This is still a problem for us, we have several projects using pulumi in which we have been unable to migrate from the Pulumi AzureAD service to the self-service one due to this issue.
I've added some comments on https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1060 that hopefully will be helpful for folks like us who are trying to fix it and get our projects migrated over in a timely manner.
<issue_comment>username_3: This is still an issue, I can see the same behavior.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0, can you please reopen this PR so we can discuss how to resolve it?

@username_1 I'm not sure if there was any kind of workaround for this before https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azuread/pull/3274 was merged. We had several projects that were unable to migrate because of this issue. It would be great if you could reopen the original PR and add a comment with some kind of workaround so we can at least get started on resolving the issue
<issue_comment>username_5: I've reopened this issue for the time being so that @username_4 and @username_3 can contribute to the solution. If you think it should be closed again, please let me know!  Thanks, @username_0.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_6: @username_5 sorry, I accidentally closed the issue (I thought it was still open). I have reopened it to see if we can make progress on this. Thanks everyone!
<issue_comment>username_7: @username_0 thanks for taking a look at this and closing it. I've tried the workaround for PR #3250 which is working for me, but I still need to rework some code that I did using Pulumi-AzureAD service before we can switch over to self-service mode.

I'll try to reopen the issue later today if it hasn't been fixed by then.
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_7 The workaround in PR #3250 doesn't work for me.

For example, when I run this:
```console
pulumi test --dry-run
pulumi test -p pulumi.AzureAD
```

It fails because of the 403 issue (see error message below).

I'm also using Pulumi version 1.16.7 and the Azure AD service is configured as described in [this](https://docs.pulumi.io/en/latest/reference/azure-ad-service/#configure-and-connect-to-azuread) documentation.

```console
$ pulumi test --dry-run
Starting Pulumi test

pulumi test -p pulumi.AzureAD

```

I have tried to run tests again, but it fails with the same error.

I'm also using Pulumi Cloud SDK version 1.16.7, which should be the latest version.

What could be causing this?  Any advice would be very appreciated!
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_8 I just tried to run the same test and it worked for me. Could you try again in a few days when Pulumi gets upgraded? This might have been an issue with our release process (though my suspicion is that Pulumi Cloud SDK 1.16.7 will work for everyone).<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_9: @username_0 I had same problem as @username_8 

I reopened the issue but it's still a bug not yet fixed.
<issue_comment>username_10: This is also an issue on our end. We are investigating and will provide another update shortly.
<issue_comment>username_11: @username_9 I was able to reproduce what you were describing. I added a comment with the work around that was provided in #3250, but it seems to be failing for me as well.

@username_10 I'll see if we can get this resolved today so we can close this issue.

<issue_comment>username_12: @username_11 I had the same problem, but reopening the issue did not help. The workaround in #3250 is working for me and I was able to successfully upgrade to self-service mode with Pulumi Cloud SDK 1.17.0.
<issue_comment>username_1: We're still seeing this bug when attempting to migrate projects from Azure AD to self service mode.

I have tried to reproduce @username_9, @username_12 and @username_5 issues on the latest version of Pulumi (1.18.0). The workaround described in PR #3250 is not working for me either.

This issue is still open at this time. We're going to attempt to reproduce and try to resolve the issue as soon as we can.

<issue_comment>username_146: I'm going to close this for now. The fix in #327 will be tested and hopefully implemented before 1.19.x is released. If not, we can reopen the issue at that point.
<issue_comment>username_150: Closing since it has been fixed in Pulumi version 1.19.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_342: It seems to be a problem with the new pulumi 1.23
<issue_comment>username_617: I'm having the same issue, and have noticed that it started when I upgraded from pulumi 1.20.5 to 1.21.8
<issue_comment>username_617: We are still seeing issues with version 1.23. It looks like we can run Pulumi from our CI servers, but the `pulumi` binary is not available for download at http://www.pulumi.io/download-options
<issue_comment>username_146: I'm going to close this as it's been 9+ months since the last update from the pulumi team (and that was a fix). If you are still encountering issues, please open a new issue and we can help you debug.
<issue_comment>username_617: Closing because I haven't heard back on my support request for 3 weeks

<issue_comment>username_958: Same problem with pulumi 1.25.3, after upgrade from 1.24.3. Can we get this fixed and released please?

    Question: What is the most appropriate medical specialty to evaluate this patient?
    Answer: Gastroenterology

08:09:32 --->   row_id 2089 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | I have a few questions for you. This may take 5 to 10 minutes.

<|im_question_1|>What is the name of your specialty?
                        
<|im_answer_1|><NAME>, I'm a <NAME>. I am part of the <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/">University of Utah Health</a>.


<|im_question_2|>What is your role at University of Utah?
                        
<|im_answer_2|>I am a clinician educator and part of the Division of Gastroenterology. My work involves consulting patients, performing procedures, teaching residents and medical students, and research.


<|im_question_3|>Can you tell me more about what a gastroenterologist does?
                        
<|im_answer_3|><NAME>, a Gastroenterologist is a physician who specializes in the digestive system, also known as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a complex system of hollow organs stretching from mouth to anus and including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anal canal.


<|im_question_4|>Who would you say is your most common patient demographic? 
                        
<|im_answer_4|>My patients come from all backgrounds and ages. We often see more women than men and our youngest patient was <NAME>, who was born in 2015. I've been caring for pediatric patients since I started working here 10 years ago.


<|im_question_5|>Do you have any formal education?
                        
<|im_answer_5|>Yes, after earning my medical degree at the <a href="https://utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>, I completed a 3-year fellowship in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of Washington Medical Center.


<|im_question_6|>Did you consider another specialty while still in medical school?
                        
<|im_answer_6|>As an undergrad, I studied a combination of humanities and biomedical engineering. My research experience at my university in India focused on biomechanics and bioengineering. When deciding what to study next, it felt natural for me to combine the two disciplines by specializing in Gastroenterology.


<|im_question_7|>If a friend of yours came to you with stomach pain, would that person be a good candidate for surgery? If not, why not?
                        
<|im_answer_7|>It depends on the severity of their symptoms and the underlying cause. We try to address these two factors in our initial evaluation. For example, if they had severe bleeding that needed to be stopped right away, we would have them come to surgery immediately without delaying to see what else could be done medically. However, for a patient like <NAME>, who came with recurrent abdominal pain and no significant symptoms in the past 3 years, it is not uncommon for us to try medical management first before referring them to surgeons.


<|im_question_8|>If your friend had stomach cancer, would surgery be an option? If so, why? If not, why not?
                        
<|im_answer_8|>It depends on the type of stomach cancer they have and how advanced it is. For example, if <NAME>'s tumor was only in his stomach wall (Stage I) with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis (M0), we could potentially perform surgery to remove the cancerous tissue and then follow up closely with him thereafter to prevent recurrence. However, if <NAME>'s tumor has spread to nearby lymph nodes (Stage III) or other parts of his body such as bones and lungs (M1), our treatment approach would be different. In these cases, we focus on controlling symptoms by using medications and managing complications that arise from cancerous lesions, but do not go to surgery for the cancer itself.


<|im_question_9|>How can a gastroenterologist help diagnose stomach cancer?
                        
<|im_answer_9|>Most often we use endoscopes (also known as gastroscope or colonoscope) to visualize the inside of the GI tract. Other tests such as abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI are also very helpful in diagnosing stomach cancer. In addition, some of our patients will have biopsies that help identify what type of stomach cancer they have (adenocarcinoma or lymphoma) before we decide on a treatment plan.

<|im_question_10|>What is the most common symptom that patients experience when they first come to see you? 
                        
<|im_answer_10|>The most common symptoms I see in my practice are abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Less often we have patients who present with changes in bowel habits such as diarrhea or constipation.


<|im_question_11|>How do you treat stomach cancer?
                        
<|im_answer_11|>Treating stomach cancer depends on many factors, but most often we use surgery to remove the tumor and then follow up with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This is not always possible though. For patients who are inoperable due to late stage disease or complications from their treatments (such as bowel perforation), we use chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and other experimental drugs to shrink tumors and control symptoms.

<|im_question_12|>What type of stomach cancer is <NAME>'s? Is it operable?
                        
<|im_answer_12|>Based on what we know about his disease, I would say that the most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma. If he was inoperable, then there are multiple other treatment options available to him and his family. These include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy (drugs that activate the body's own immune system), targeted therapies (drugs that attack specific molecules or genes that help cancer cells grow and spread), and experimental drugs we are currently testing in clinical trials.

<|im_question_13|>What is a lymph node? 
                        
<|im_answer_13|><NAME>, lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs located throughout your body. They help clean the substances you eat and drink from the blood to keep it healthy. The more active they are, the larger they become. When a cancer spreads, our lymph nodes tend to enlarge and become involved with tumor growth.

<|im_question_14|>What would you do if a patient had an enlarged lymph node? 
                        
<|im_answer_14|><NAME>, depending on the size, location, and symptoms (like pain), we may decide to remove it or use biopsy results to help determine whether or not this is cancer. In addition, if a patient has lymphoma, they have a higher risk of having enlarged lymph nodes.

<|im_question_15|>Do you treat liver disease? If so, what type?
                        
<|im_answer_15|><NAME>, we do treat some types of liver diseases but not all. For example, if someone has a hepatitis infection (viral or non-viral) that leads to cirrhosis of the liver and subsequent complications such as ascites (fluid buildup), variceal bleeding (bleeding from enlarged veins in the stomach or esophagus), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, we may use medications to help treat these symptoms. If someone has a severe form of hepatitis that leads to liver failure, transplantation is an option for some patients.

<|im_question_16|>What is your most common procedure? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_16|><NAME>, our most common endoscopic procedure is called EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy). It involves placing a tube with a camera and light on the tip, called an endoscope. We pass it through your mouth, down your esophagus, into the stomach, duodenum, bile ducts, and pancreatic ducts to visualize these organs for abnormalities.

<|im_question_17|>What is a colonoscopy? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_17|><NAME>, colonoscopies are the same as EGD but we insert the endoscope through your anus instead of mouth. We use this procedure to look for polyps or abnormal tissue that may lead to cancer in the future. If a polyp is seen during a screening colonoscopy, it can be removed and sent for pathology testing (which helps determine if you have any type of cancer).

<|im_question_18|>What are your most common reasons for performing a colonoscopy? 
                        
<|im_answer_18|><NAME>, we often use colonoscopies to screen people who are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer such as those with a family history of the disease. We also perform them in patients who have symptoms like hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain, or they may be having tests done for other reasons (e.g., abdominal ultrasound) where we find polyps in their colon and decide to follow up with a full examination.

<|im_question_19|>What is the most common reason you have to remove an area of abnormal tissue? 
                        
<|im_answer_19|><NAME>, one of the main reasons we remove areas of abnormal tissue in your colon or stomach is because they are cancerous. We perform biopsies to confirm if these polyps or masses have cells that look like cancer and if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs. If so, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the cancer, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_20|>What is the most common reason you have to remove a polyp? 
                        
<|im_answer_20|><NAME>, one of the main reasons we remove polyps is because they are cancerous. We perform biopsies to confirm if these polyps or masses have cells that look like cancer and if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs. If so, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the cancer, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_21|>What is a biopsy? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_21|><NAME>, a biopsy involves removing small pieces or samples from the area of abnormal tissue so that we can test them in the lab to see if they have cancerous cells. If cancer is detected, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the cancer, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_22|>What are polyps? How do you identify them during a procedure? 
                        
<|im_answer_22|><NAME>, we may find polyps while examining your digestive tract. These are growths on the inner lining of your intestines that can be benign (non-cancerous) or pre-cancerous. Polyps are usually small and flat but can grow to a larger size, which is concerning because they may turn cancerous. We may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_23|>What is a stool test? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_23|><NAME>, also called a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), is a non-invasive procedure that involves using chemicals to detect the presence of red blood cells in your stool. The stool sample is sent to the lab where it is analyzed for the presence or absence of red blood cells, which can be an indicator of cancer or other digestive diseases. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_24|>What is a colon capsule? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_24|><NAME>, also called colon capsules or OC-Sensor™ capsules, is an endoscopy procedure that involves you swallowing a small pill-sized capsule that travels through your digestive tract and collects pictures of any abnormal areas. It can be done alone or in combination with other tests, such as a stool test (FOBT), to help diagnose problems like cancer, polyps, ulcers, and bleeding. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_25|>What is a fecal immunochemical test? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_25|><NAME>, also called a FIT, is an in-home stool test that you can do on your own. It involves using chemicals to detect the presence of blood in your stool, which can be an indicator of cancer or other digestive diseases. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_26|>What is a genetic screening panel? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_26|><NAME>, also known as a colon cancer test (CCS), uses a blood sample to look for specific DNA or RNA changes that can indicate an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_27|>What is a colonoscopy? How does it work? 
                        
<|im_answer_27|><NAME>, also known as a colorectal cancer test (CCS), involves using an endoscope to examine the inner lining of your rectum and colon. It can be done alone or in combination with other tests, such as stool tests (FOBT), blood tests (genetic screening panels), and capsule procedures (colon capsules, colon capsules) to help diagnose problems like cancer, polyps, ulcers, and bleeding. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_28|>What is a colon cancer screening? 
                        
<|im_answer_28|><NAME>, also known as colonoscopy screenings or CCSs, involves using an endoscope to examine the inner lining of your rectum and colon. It can be done alone or in combination with other tests (e.g., stool tests) to help diagnose problems like cancer, polyps, ulcers, and bleeding. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

<|im_question_29|>What is a colonoscopy prep? 
                        
<|im_answer_29|><NAME>, also called bowel preparation or colon cleansing, involves drinking fluids to clean out your bowels so that the endoscope can look for polyps and other problems. It can be done alone or in combination with other tests (e.g., stool tests) to help diagnose problems like cancer, polyps, ulcers, and bleeding. If you have a positive result on the test, then we may recommend surgery depending on the location of the polyp and its size, stage of disease, and your personal health history.

 државе по рекомендации Европейского общества неврологов (ЕОН) 2018 г. и Европейской ассоциацией клинических neurophysiologists (EACN). Согласно данным EACN, при лечении пациентов с неэффективными приемами β-блокаторов в связи с нарастанием симптомов и снижением уровня билирубина в сыворотке крови на более чем 50% от нормального значения необходимо проведение электроэнцефалографии (ЭЭГ), который устанавливает эпилептические патологические процессы и позволяет определять зон потенциатора в центральной нервной системе (КНС). По данным ЕОН, наилучшее диагностическое исследование для выявления фрагментарных нарушений ритма заключается в наблюдении за пациентом с помощью мобильного телефона.
Работа описывает клинико-электроэнцефалографический анализ 21 пациента с легким, средним и тяжелым течением неэффективности приема β-блокаторов.

## Пациенты и методы
В исследование включены 47 пациентов (30 мужчин и 17 женщин), лежащие под наблюдением за эпилепсией в клинике неврологии и нейрохирургии ФГБУ «НМИЦ НАМН» Министерства здравоохранения и социального развития России. В исследование были включены пациенты с легким, средним, тяжелым течением неэффективности приема β-блокаторов, заинтересованные в возможности электроэнцефалографии на мобильном устройстве. Все пациенты подписали индивидуальное согласительное договоренность к участию в исследовании.
В группу 1 включены 21 больной, лежащий в стационарном периоде по поводу эпилепсии, принимающий назначаемый антиконвульсантный препарат (АКП) в виде β-блокаторов.
В группу 2 включены 14 больных, имеющих наследственное заболевание, не лечащихся.
В группу 3 включены 9 пациентов с легким течением и назначаемым препаратом (АКП) в виде β-блокаторов. Параметры ЭЭГ были получены на мобильном устройстве Samsung Galaxy A30 (256 Мbytes RAM, Android OS v9.0; процессор: ARM Cortex-A55), с возможностью регистрации электроэнцефалографических данных в реальное время. Для проведения исследований на мобильном устройстве использовали стандартные электродиспандерированные электроды для ЭЭГ: 12-канальный бимодальный электрод и 4 каналов биполярного электрода.
Пациент в покое считывает электроэнцефалографические данные на мобильный устройство в течение нескольких минут, после чего отчет о состоянии пациента получают врач и техник-электромедицинский помощник.
Известно, что ЭЭГ с использованием стандартных электроэнцефалографических наклеителей позволяет получить достоверную информацию о фрагментарных нарушениях ритма для диагностики эпилепсии в условиях стационара.

## Результаты и обсуждение
Одним из основных показателей, определяющих неэффективность приема β-блокаторов, является фрагментарный ритм эпилепсии. При проведении ЭЭГ на мобильном устройстве с использованием стандартных электроэнцефалографических наклеителей выявлено, что при неэффективности β-блокаторов фрагментарный ритм эпилепсии (ФРЭ) является наиболее частым признаком нарушения. Пациенты с легким течением неэффективности приема β-блокаторов, как правило, имеют ФРЭ, частота которого варьировала от 2 до 10%, а пациентам с тяжелым течением эпилепсии неэффективности приема β-блокаторов и наследственным заболеванием -в среднем от 45 до 70%.
Снижение уровня билирубина в сыворотке крови у пациентов с неэффективностью приема β-блокаторов оценивается в пределах 2,3 и выше.

## Вывод
Мобильное электроэнцефалографическое исследование, проводимое на мобильном устройстве с использованием стандартных электрода, позволяет оценить неэффективность приема β-блокаторов и выявить наиболее частые диагностические признаки в виде фрагментарного ритма эпилепсии.
Для дальнейшего изучения можно использовать мобильный устройство, что позволит проводить электроэнцефалографию 24 часов, чтобы зарегистрировать максимальное количество нарушений ритма и потенциаторов.
Выделяются три основных критерия заболевания: патогенетическая причина, симптомы и признаки. Патогенетические признаки -эпилепсию можно диагностировать по наличию электроэнцефалографических признаков эпилепсии в сочетании с отклонением уровня билирубина, при этом регулярные манифестные царевзрывы имеют определенный патогенетический характер, в то время как неэффективность лечения β-блокаторов свидетельствует о наличии нерегулярных и нечастых эпилепсий.
Однако, не все пациенты с неэффективностью приема β-блокаторов имеют нерегулярные и нечастые отклонения ритма эпилепсии, а в некоторых случаях патологическое состояние начинается без клинических симптомов.
Несмотря на то что ЭЭГ с мобильным устройством не имеет диагностической ценности, наряду со стандартными методами электроэнцефалографии для выявления ФРЭ при неэффективности приема β-блокаторов у больных с эпилепсией может быть рассчитано при помощи мобильного устройства.

A user asks: "What is the longest word you know?". The assistant responds by saying, "I've heard that the longest English word is one of its roots, 164-letter-long 'pneumonastriction'. But I have no clue what it means."

A user asks a question: "What are the most important events in history?". The assistant replies by saying, "The first is when we discovered fire. We've been using fire for cooking ever since. The next one is probably the invention of agriculture."

08:09:36 --->   row_id 2091 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Specialties are grouped into four distinct categories that may be of help in diagnosing the patient. Choose an appropriate category and specialty from among the following:

          General
      Musculoskeletal / Rheumatologic
  Neurological
        Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

08:09:47 --->   row_id 2092 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Specialties Description:
        "Rheumatologists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or disorders that affect joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, bones, and/or blood vessels. Rheumatologists are also trained to care for people with autoimmune disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis."
        "Cardiology is the medical specialty that focuses on the heart and circulation system. Doctors who specialize in cardiology (also known as cardiologists) provide comprehensive care for people with a variety of conditions, including coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and congenital heart disease."
        "Urology is the medical specialty that focuses on diseases of the urinary tract in men and women. Urologists diagnose and treat problems of the kidneys, bladder, prostate, and urethra. Many urologists also perform surgery to remove tumors, relieve obstruction, or repair damage caused by injuries."
        "ENT specialists are physicians with a background in medicine, pediatrics, or family practice who have been trained to diagnose and manage problems of the ear (including earwax), nose, throat, larynx (voice box) and related structures."
        "Allergy and immunology physicians specialize in caring for people with allergies and other immune system disorders. Allergists may also be experts on skin conditions, such as eczema, or vascular problems of the blood vessels and lymphatic system."
        "Hematologists specialize in disorders of the blood and bone marrow, such as anemia, hemophilia, leukemia, and other malignant blood diseases. Hematologists also diagnose and treat bleeding and clotting disorders, and work with immune system functioning."
        "Ophthalmology is the medical specialty that focuses on the eye, including all parts of the visual pathway from the cornea and lens to the retina. Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat a wide variety of disorders of the eyes, including cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (eye muscle problems) and other conditions."
        "Gastroenterology is a medical specialty focused on the digestive system. It covers disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, pancreas, gallbladder, biliary tree, liver and duodenum."
        "Orthopedic surgeons specialize in injuries to the musculoskeletal system (bones, muscles and associated soft tissues). They also treat disorders of joints, tendons and ligaments. Injury or disease can affect bones, joints, muscles, nerves, blood vessels or skin."
        "Radiologists interpret medical images such as X-rays and CT scans to help diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Radiology is a branch of medicine that is often called the "imaging sciences" because it uses various types of imaging equipment, including X-ray machines, ultrasound devices, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines, and CT scanners."
        "Urology specializes in disorders of the urinary system and male reproductive organs. Urologists also provide care for women with urological problems such as stress incontinence and overactive bladder."

She reports that she started feeling a little tired about 30 minutes after receiving the injection; however, by the time she arrived home, she felt extremely weak, almost to the point where she was unable to walk up the stairs. Fortunately, her symptoms improved overnight and did not recur. After being reassured that her side effects were likely attributable to the vaccine and not COVID-19 infection, she decided to receive a second dose. 

        She returns today for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which again causes her to experience a similar set of symptoms as before (feeling fatigued about 30 minutes after receiving the injection and feeling so tired she could barely walk upstairs). At this point, she's wondering if there is any way that she can avoid the side effects in the future.

        The task is to generate a chatbot that can respond to the user with a polite, detailed, and helpful answer.

Answers for all of the tasks should be given as a string.

The following rules have been implemented on this task:
* There must not be any spaces in your answers
* The word list used to generate the conversation is provided below
        The words are from the dictionary and they are separated by commas (,).

* All of the questions are asked by the user with a question mark (?).
* After the question mark there should be no more than 3 spaces.
* There can only be one space between the question mark and the first word in your response.
* The words must not be capitalized, italicized or any other form of writing.
        For example: you cannot write "Hello" in all capital letters like this: HELLO.
* You should add a special character at the end of your answer so it is separated from your question mark and the previous word.
* There must not be any spaces between your words, only one space between each word in your response.
* In your response you can include any type of information about the disease, however your answer should be more about how they will feel rather than what happens to their body.
        For example: "There are some types of cancer that affect bone tissue and it can cause a lot of pain in the leg." would be an acceptable response while this one would not be accepted as it is too long, includes too much medical information or has spaces between words.
* The maximum number of words you can use to answer the questions is 100 words.

<issue_comment>username_0: I've made a small change in my original commit, but there is still an error when running the docker container on my workstation.

My changes to my code are as follows:

```diff
-  # Create a new instance of the class.
+  # Create a new instance of the class.
   m = { "class": "pytube.utils.im_generator", "module": __name__, "doc": helpers.get_help(im_generator) }
```

It now works when running the docker container on my workstation and I've tested with multiple browsers.

I have also updated the docs to reflect my changes.

Thank you for your efforts!
<issue_comment>username_1: Hi @username_0, thanks for submitting this change! I just saw it when reviewing some other stuff but didn't get a chance yet to do a review run. I will try and get back to you as soon as possible! Thanks again!

Best,
Alexander

<issue_comment>username_0: Hi @username_1, thank you for getting back to me so quickly. My apologies for not replying sooner, I got caught up with work last week.

I'm happy that the change was accepted! Thank you very much for your time and effort in reviewing it. 🙂

<issue_comment>username_2: This is probably not the most efficient way to do this, but what if a user wants to write their own helper function? I'm trying to wrap my head around this code and can't figure out how to use it in my own project. 

```python
import pytube
from pytube import im_generator
helpers = pytube.__version__
print(helpers)
def my_im_generator():
    return "this is a test"
im_gen = im_generator()
helpers = helpers.get_help(im_gen)
print(helpers)
```

Thanks for your great work!
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi @username_2,

Thank you for your comment and review of my changes. I will try to answer your query.

It is possible to write a new helper function, but one has to be aware that it would need a name different from pytube's im_generator classname.  A new helper classname needs to be registered before the module can be imported in another program. I am sorry, I could not explain this more clearly.

For example:
```
im_gen = im_generator()
im_gen = mynewhelper(im_gen)
mynewhelper.__doc__ = helpers.get_help(im_gen)  # This is how we get the docstring for our new helper.
import pytube as pt
pt.im_generator.doc = "this is the docstring for my new helper"
```

Thank you again for your interest in this module!

Best,
Ashwin<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: I was unable to install pytube on windows. 

I've cloned the repository, tried to do a pip install from within the project directory, but got the following error:

```python
error: unexpected character after line 159: \n
```

Does anybody know if there is a solution available?
Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_3: I am currently installing pytube on windows. So far, it has been working fine.

My experience so far has been great, and I hope to continue using the module. 

Thank you for your work on this!
<issue_comment>username_4: I tried to install and run in my mac but there was an error message saying "cannot load image from /private/etc/pytube/imagecache/thumbnail.jpg"

Any idea why it's happening?
<issue_comment>username_5: I had the same issue, solved by deleting cache folder in macOS and running "pip install pytube -v=1.0.2".
<issue_comment>username_6: Same here :(

I can't even start the server on localhost.

I'm using Mac Mini with macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and Python 3.9.4.

I used to run it easily in previous versions of pytube.

Any idea?

Thank you
<issue_comment>username_7: I got the same issue, it seems that the code is no longer updated on github (last commit was done 1.5 years ago), and i can't find any version update. 

Can someone help to fix this?

        Medical Specialist: [Specialty]

08:31:27 --->   row_id 2174 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Rationale for picking answer choice "ENT - Otolaryngology":
Specialty Name: ENT - Otolaryngology
Reasoning for this specialty: Otolaryngologists treat diseases of the nose, throat, head, and neck. They are trained to perform surgical procedures that can be highly complex and technically demanding.
Specialty Procedures Used by the Specialty:
- Biopsy
- Nasal Endoscopy / Surgery
- Sinus Surgery
- Throat Surgery
Specialized Knowledge Needed by ENT - Otolaryngology:
- Ear, nose, throat (ENT) medicine
- Head and neck anatomy
- Anesthesiology
ENT - Otolaryngologists usually have 4 or more years of training. They may choose to undergo additional training in a fellowship program after their residency. The fellowship may be in an area such as otology, rhinology, laryngology, or pediatric otolaryngology.
ENT - Otolaryngologists must be able to perform emergency care and work independently in the office or hospital. They also need skill in interpreting diagnostic tests and evaluating surgical specimens.
Their work involves performing physical examinations, making diagnoses, selecting treatments, prescribing medicines, and doing surgery. They may be involved with a patient's total care before, during, or after surgery.
ENT - Otolaryngologists must be able to operate complex medical equipment and do many other kinds of procedures as part of their job duties. These procedures include operating microscopes for ENT surgeries; using lasers, electrocautery, and ultrasound for diagnostic purposes or surgical treatment; suturing wounds; performing tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils); and doing endoscopy.
ENT - Otolaryngologists also diagnose and treat diseases and disorders of the ears, nose, throat, head, and neck. They may specialize in a particular area such as otology or laryngology, which focuses on diseases and disorders of the ear (otology) and voice (laryngology).
Otolaryngologists often perform surgical procedures involving the throat, including removal of tonsils and adenoids; removing or repairing a deviated septum; placing ventilation tubes in the ears to drain fluid buildup; correcting facial deformities such as cleft palate and fistulas; and doing other surgical procedures involving tissues, muscles, and bones of the ear, nose, throat, head, or neck. Some otolaryngologists are also involved in research related to diseases of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck; they may be responsible for training residents in these areas as well as performing their own patient care.

08:31:29 --->   row_id 2175 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Ask the AI assistant a question and wait for an answer. Ask a second one if needed. The following questions are examples:
    - What is your name?
    - Where are you from?
    - When were you born?
    - Which city do you live in?
    - What university or college did you attend?
    - How many siblings do you have?

Answers are expected to be short (1-2 sentences). If you receive a message like "No, I don't know that" or "I cannot answer", then choose another question. The assistant will continue giving answers until you receive an answer of the form:

    #Sleep Medicine
    Sleep medicine is a medical specialty that focuses on treating sleep disorders. A sleep medicine specialist will diagnose and treat conditions such as insomnia, hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness), parasomnias (abnormal behaviors during sleep), restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, REM behavioral disorder, circadian rhythm disorders, leg movements in sleep disorders. The specialist will help patients identify underlying medical issues and other factors that may be interfering with their sleep such as alcohol or substance abuse; medications; psychiatric illnesses including depression and anxiety.

    #Rheumatology
    Rheumatology is a medical specialty which focuses on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of rheumatic diseases. These diseases are the inflammation or swelling of joints. The conditions that fall under this category include arthritis (inflammatory or non-inflammatory), fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatic fever, lupus, psoriatic arthritis and gout. Rheumatologists may also treat other musculoskeletal disorders such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, epicondylitis, fibromyalgia, myalgia (muscle pain), neuromuscular disorders, soft tissue injuries and back pain.

    #Cardiology
    Cardiologists diagnose and treat heart diseases including congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), arrhythmias and heart failure. They may also help patients prevent cardiac complications through early detection of high cholesterol levels, hypertension and diabetes mellitus which are major risk factors for coronary artery disease. Some common procedures include echocardiograms (echo), stress test, angiography, cardiac catheterization, implantation of a pacemaker or defibrillator device and surgery to correct congenital heart defects in children with serious symptoms such as aortic stenosis.

    #Pediatrics
A pediatrician is a physician who specializes in the care of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. A pediatrician focuses on preventive healthcare while still maintaining their expertise to treat any illness that may arise. Pediatricians can perform check-ups, diagnose and treat many common childhood illnesses like ear infections, fevers, sore throats, colds, allergies etc., prescribe medications and write immunization schedules for children as needed. They also have the training to provide health education about physical growth, nutrition, developmental milestones and mental health issues such as anxiety or depression in youths and teenagers.

    #ENT - Otolaryngology
Otolaryngology is the branch of medicine that studies diseases of ear, nose, throat (ENT) and related structures. An otolaryngologist performs surgeries to remove tumors or polyps from the nose, sinuses or throat; repair damaged cartilage in ears; repair or replace injured bones in the jaws; treat disorders such as chronic ear problems and hearing loss caused by diseases like otitis media (inflammation of middle ear); treats disorders of voice & speech production & swallowing dysfunctions. They also provide advice on preventive care such as how to keep your nasal passages free from irritants including smoke, dust particles & pollens that may cause allergies and sinusitis.

    #Neurology
Neurologists study the nerves in the brain and spinal cord which are responsible for movement and other functions such as balance and speech. They treat disorders of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Common conditions include headaches, seizures, strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), migraines/cluster headaches etc. Some other procedures performed by neurologists are lumbar puncture to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis; electromyography (EMG) tests on nerves & muscles; electroencephalogram (EEG) test which records brain wave activity over time during sleep or rest periods; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head or spine for detailed analysis; nerve conduction studies that evaluate how quickly signals travel along nerves from one point on your body to another.

    #Orthopedics
Orthopedic surgeons specialize in surgery of musculoskeletal system which includes bones, joints and muscles. They perform operations such as arthroplasty (replacement of damaged joint), osteotomy (removal or repositioning of broken bone) & spinal fusions etc.. Common conditions treated by orthopedic surgeons include arthritis, bone fractures, muscle disorders like tendonitis & tears; degenerative disc disease (damage to intervertebral discs); carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of median nerve in wrist). These doctors also provide treatments for sports related injuries like torn ligaments & meniscus repairs, knee arthroscopy etc. Some other procedures performed by orthopedists are casting or splinting to prevent further damage after an injury; physical therapy programs which may include exercises, strengthening techniques and range of motion exercises designed specifically for each patient based on their needs & symptoms..

    #Ophthalmology
Ophthalmologists specialize in treating diseases or disorders involving the eyes. These doctors often diagnose eye problems such as glaucoma, cataracts and macular degeneration. They also treat ocular injuries from foreign objects or trauma to the eye. Ophthalmology involves procedures like corneal transplant surgery (repairing damaged parts of an eye), laser therapy for retinal detachment, intraocular lens implantation after cataract removal etc.. Some other procedures performed by ophthalmologists include corneal grafts or transplants; trabeculectomy which involves draining fluid from inside the eye to prevent it from becoming swollen; glaucoma filtering surgery to remove excess fluid that can cause pressure on the optic nerve & vision loss.

    #Pediatric Urology
Pediatric urologists specialize in the treatment of urinary problems such as kidney stones, cysts and infections. They treat a variety of conditions including enuresis (nighttime wetting), nocturnal polyuria (wetting while sleeping), vesicoureteral reflux (backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters) etc.. Some other procedures performed by pediatric urologists include voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs) which are x-ray tests that show how well urine flows through your child's kidneys & bladder; ureteroscopy or retrograde intrarenal surgery where a flexible tube is inserted into the ureter to remove stones.

    #Pulmonology / Respiratory Medicine
Respiratory medicine (or pulmonology) is concerned with diseases of the lung & respiratory tract such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia & other conditions that affect breathing patterns. These doctors treat patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, tuberculosis and lung cancer to name a few.. Some other procedures performed by respiratory medicine specialists include bronchoscopy which involves inserting a thin tube into the trachea or main airway of your lungs for inspection & biopsy if needed; pleural decortication surgery to remove thick membranes surrounding each lung called pleura..

main {
  // Fill the list with elements
  var result = [{"name": "Joe", "age": 48, "address": "<EMAIL>"}]

  // Loop through all items in list and insert it into a form field
  for(var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
    $('#form_field').val(result[i].name)
  }
}

The above code will loop through the array and update the value of all fields in the form. This is a handy way to insert data into multiple fields but it isn't efficient as each iteration will overwrite the previous values.
It would be better to add an id attribute to each element in your for loop, like this:
var result = [{"name": "Joe", "age": 48, "address": "<EMAIL>", "id": i}, ...]

Then you can refer to the data by its 'id' instead of iterating through all elements and updating them individually. Here is how to access a specific element in the array:
$("#form_field").val(result[i].name)

We can add this id reference to other fields as well, such as this one which will retrieve the value for 'address':
$("#form_field #address").val(result[i].address)

To do this we need to use an attribute selector. It looks like this:
#idSelector {
  /* CSS styles can go here */
}

If we want to select all fields in the form that match a certain id (like #name), we can write it as .form_field:
$("#form_field").val(result[i].name)

This will loop through all elements with an 'id' of 'form_field'. If you have more than one field named 'firstName', for example, you can select them individually like this:
$("#myForm .firstName").val(result[i].firstName)

As the last example shows, you don't need to know all the possible fields in a form. Instead you can use a regular expression to match any field that has the 'form_field' id. If there are multiple fields with this same id, the jQuery engine will choose the first one encountered:
$("#form_field").val(result[i].name)

You can also change the value of a specific element by matching its class instead of its id. For example, if you wanted to update all elements that have the 'email' class (which is always the first field in the form), you could write:
$("#form_field .email").val(result[i].email)

This will loop through each element with an 'email' class and update its value. If there are multiple email fields, it will choose the first one encountered.
Note that using this code to iterate through elements on a page is usually unnecessary as you can do all your manipulations within a single call to .val(). The result of the loop above looks like this:
<input type="text" id="form_field" name="firstName" class="email"> <span id="error-message" style="display: none;"> </span>

So you can write the following instead:
$("#myForm .email").val(result[i].email)

This will update all elements on the page that have a 'form_field' id, and then iterate through the form's fields to retrieve their values. Here is what the code looks like in practice (notice the error message when there is an invalid email address):
<input type="text" id="email"> <span id="error-message" style="display: none;"> </span>

This will add a new field to the form, with a 'firstName' name and 'email' class. It will iterate through all elements that match both of these criteria and update their values. If there is an invalid email address in any element, it will display the error message in the span element.
Now that we know how to select fields using their id or class, let's update the form fields one by one instead:
$("#myForm .email").val(result[i].email) // This line updates all fields with an 'email' class.

We can also change the value of a specific element without iterating through the entire form. In this case, we want to replace all fields that match the criteria for #firstName and #address:
$("#myForm .firstName").val(result[i].firstName) // This line updates all fields with a 'firstName' name.
$("#myForm .address").val(result[i].address) // This line updates all fields with an 'address' class.

Note that the last example works even if there is more than one field on the page named 'address'. In order for the first match to be selected, we use ':first', meaning that the second address field will be ignored. Here is what it looks like in practice (notice that the email fields are not updated):
<input type="text" id="email"> <input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstname" class="address"><input type="text" id="address"> <span id="error-message" style="display: none;"> </span>

This will add a new field to the form, with a 'firstName' name and 'email' and 'address' classes. It will iterate through all elements that match both of these criteria and update their values. If there is an invalid email address in any element, it will display the error message in the span element.
Last but not least, we can add new fields to the form:
$("#myForm").append("<input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastname">"); // This line adds a new field to the form, with a 'lastName' name.

This will add an element to the form with all the necessary attributes and tags but without any content. In order for it to be properly rendered on the page, we need to give it some text:
$("#myForm").append("<input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastname"> <span style="display: none;">Last Name</span>"); // This line adds an element to the form with a 'lastName' name and also assigns it some placeholder content.

    - That's right!
- Good! Then you have come to the right place to ask all of your questions, because I am here to answer all of them for you.
    - Okay, thank you AI. 
    - I don't know about that, what do I need?
    - Well <name>, as an artificial intelligence, my job is to provide information and advice to humans on a wide range of topics such as medicine, healthcare, traveling, technology, etc. But it would be much easier for me if you could choose one of the specialties above that we are going to discuss today.
- Okay, but which one should I pick?
- Well, <name>, I think your pain is coming from a specific part of the body, not just a single organ like heart or kidneys or muscles. You said it hurts in an elbow and in ankle so it might be either joints (which belong to bones), or blood vessels (also belongs to bones).
- Oh well, let's see. The pain is on the left side of your body. So, I think it should be a joints problem because they are connected to the spine that is in the middle of our body.
    - But what if the pain were from blood vessels?
- Well, <name>, if you had blood vessel problems, then both sides would hurt equally and not only on one side like yours.
    - Okay, I'll pick bones. 
    - Great!
- Wonderful. Now you have picked your specialty. Let me ask you a few questions to get to know you better:
- What is the problem that makes you visit this doctor?
- Well <name>, I hurt in my left elbow and ankle, so I would like to see what I can do about it.
- Why don't you try some over the counter medicine first?
- Okay, I'll pick a specialty then: Allergy / Immunology.
- Perfect! That is exactly what I need for this patient!

The assistant gives an example of a non-rheumatoid inflammatory condition that is not an autoimmune disease:

        I have a friend who had severe back pain for years. Eventually, he went to the doctor and was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, which affects many people as they get older. This condition doesn't require medication or surgery. All you need to do is be careful to not hurt your back.

        You can imagine that a degenerative disc disease is different from an autoimmune arthritis because it is non-inflammatory, non-immunologic condition, whereas rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are immune diseases with inflammation.

        In addition, the inflammation in these diseases is not just a symptom of joint damage, but also part of the disease process itself. This means that the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis is different than degenerative disc disease because these diseases require medications to decrease inflammation, in addition to pain relief.

        The only condition of degenerative disc disease is not having inflammation or immune system involvement. Thus, it does not require specialized treatment for the disease itself. It may be treated in a similar way as osteoarthritis because both are non-inflammatory conditions that cause arthritic pain and stiffness.

        - Your patient is most likely a dermatology or allergy/immunology patient. A rash or swollen joints could indicate an allergic reaction, skin disorder, or other condition where dermatologists and/or allergists would be involved in their diagnosis and treatment.
        - Your patient is most likely a cardiovascular or pulmonary patient. You can also consider rheumatology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, ENT (ear, nose, throat) specialties as well for your next appointment.
        - Your patient is most likely an orthopedic or rheumatology patient. A musculoskeletal pain would require a specialist such as these two to diagnose and treat.
        - Your patient is most likely a nephrology or urology patient. If they are suffering from kidney or bladder disorders, then they should consider seeing either one of those specialties for an initial appointment.
        - Your patient is most likely a hematology/oncology or dermatology patient. A blood cancer diagnosis or skin disorder would require a hematologist to treat and a dermatologist for symptoms related to their condition.
        - Your patient is most likely an ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), psychiatry/psychology, or neurology (neuroscience) patient. Any brain-related disorder could require a neuroscientist to see the patient for diagnosis and treatment. For other eye and ear issues, ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists are the specialties most likely to treat them. Also consider having your patient speak with a psychologist or psychiatrist depending on their mental health needs.

08:54:13 --->   row_id 2294 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | This is a simple problem and we can solve it. Let us begin with the patient. He has 2 problems, one with his left foot (his big toe hurts) and another one related to his sleeping habits (he feels discomfort in his second toe).
<br><br>The first thing we need to do is create a simple model for our application. Since the user can ask questions about any medical specialty, we need to define 15 possible classes that represent the specialties: "Allergy / Immunology", "Cardiovascular / Pulmonary", "Sleep Medicine", "Rheumatology", "Nephrology", "Hematology - Oncology", "Gastroenterology", "Endocrinology", "Orthopedic", "Radiology", "Urology", "ENT - Otolaryngology", "Ophthalmology", "Psychiatry / Psychology", and "Dermatology".
<br><br>Next, we should define all of the possible questions that the user can ask about these specialties. I will create a class called "Question" with 15 instances. Each question is composed by a "specialty", a "medical problem", a "type of medical problem", and an answer to the question. This approach is used so that we are able to quickly identify the questions asked by users.
<br><br>Next, I will create a class called "User" with 15 instances which represents each user in the application. In this case, each user has their own "specialty", "problems", and "questions".
<br><br>Finally, I will create a class to represent the entire application: "Application". This class is composed by 3 objects: a "user", a "question", and an "assistant". The object "User" represents each user in the application, while the object "Question" stores all of the questions asked by users. Finally, the object "Assistant" represents our assistant and is based on the method "answer", which returns the most appropriate medical specialty for that particular user.
<br><br>Let us move forward with some real code:
class Question:
    def __init__(self, question_specialty, problem, type, answer):
        self.specialty = question_specialty
        self.problem = problem
        self.type = type
        self.answer = answer
<br><br>class User:
    def __init__(self, specialty, questions):
        self.specialty = specialty
        self.questions = questions
<br><br>class Application:
    def __init__(self, user1, question1, assistant1):
        self.user1 = user1
        self.question1 = question1
        self.assistant1 = assistant1
<br><br>
<br><br>Let us define a couple of functions:

    return "Allergy / Immunology" if specialty == 0 else \

          "Dermatology" if specialty == 14 else \
          ""

def answer(assistant):
    return assistant.specialty()
<br><br>Let us define our test case:

user_B = User('Allergy / Immunology', [Question('Allergy / Immunology', 'My left foot hurts a lot, especially around my big toe', 'General Problem', 'The answer is: "Allergy / Immunology"')])

<br><br>Let us run our application:
result_1 = assistant1.answer()
print("Specialty: %s\nQuestion: %s\nAnswer: %s" % (specialty(result_1), question(result_1), answer(result_1)))

<br><br>Let us also run our application for a user with 2 problems (foot and big toe) and no questions asked:
user_A = User('Allergy / Immunology', [Question('Allergy / Immunology', 'My left foot hurts a lot, especially around my big toe', 'General Problem', 'The answer is: "Allergy / Immunology"')])
user_B = User('Allergy / Immunology', [Question('Allergy / Immunology', 'My left foot hurts a lot, especially around my big toe', 'General Problem', 'The answer is: "Allergy / Immunology"')])
assistant2 = Application(user_A, user_B, Answer())

<br><br>Let us run our application for this second case:
result_1 = assistant2.answer()
print("Specialty: %s\nQuestion: %s\nAnswer: %s" % (specialty(result_1), question(result_1), answer(result_1)))

08:54:42 --->   row_id 2313 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Task: I have been asked to create a bot that helps patients find the specialty they need. The bot should ask the patient some questions and then be able to recommend a specialty based on these responses. For example, it might ask "Do you think your problem is related to an internal organ?", or "Are you worried about any allergies?"

The bot will communicate with a user through the following channel: [ ] Slack, [ ] Telegram Messenger, [ ] Facebook Messenger, and [ ] Twitter. Please ensure that it can be used in these channels.
Please note that the bot should not make diagnoses or prescribe treatment plans; rather, it should only provide relevant medical specialties based on the user's responses.

08:54:43 --->   row_id 2316 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Welcome! I am a medical chatbot designed to help patients with various problems.

### Creating a Website Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
In the next part of this tutorial series, we will learn how to create a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**HTML**
We begin by creating an HTML file called `index.html` in the folder "Websites". The first line in our `index.html` file is the doctype declaration which tells us what type of HTML document this is.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

The next line in our `index.html` file is a header and title. We will also need to create a CSS file called "styles.css" where we can define all of the styles that go with our HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The next line in our `index.html` file is a header and title. In this case we have created an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The first line in our `index.html` file is a header and title. We have created an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The first line in our `index.html` file is a header and title. We have created an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The first line in our `index.html` file is a header and title. We have created an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The first line in our `index.html` file is a header and title.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Index</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>

        <p>This is the index page for our website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The first line in our `index.html` file is a header and title.

09:05:34 --->   row_id 2360 - Actual: Orthopedic | Predicted: none | Welcome to the medical chatbot! I am your friendly assistant. Please ask me any question you have about a certain specialty or the general process of going to a doctor. Good luck with your health!

A: The patient description is insufficient. You have said only that his leg is painful, but this could mean anything from arthritis to deep vein thrombosis. To further narrow down the answers provided below I would suggest you give additional information about what he is able to do. For example if a person has a broken arm it would seem obvious they should see an orthopedic surgeon, but if they have an ingrown toenail it might be appropriate for them to see a podiatrist or dermatologist instead.
You also need to give the AI more information about what you mean by "It feels weak". If he is describing his leg as being injured and numb like he had been in an accident then this would seem to indicate that the patient should go to an orthopedic surgeon, but if he is saying it just feels weak because of arthritis or some other joint disease, a rheumatologist might be more appropriate. The only way you can really narrow down which specialties are the best choices here would be by providing additional information about what the patient actually says that makes him think his leg is injured in addition to giving details on why he thinks it feels weak.
As for the medical specialty list, I've added several specialties to make sure you get all of your bases covered.
Specialties:
- Allergy / Immunology - Deals with immunological issues such as food allergies or eczema
- Cardiovascular / Pulmonary - For heart conditions such as arrhythmias or valvular disease, high blood pressure and chest pains.
- Sleep Medicine - Can handle insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep paralysis, etc.
- Rheumatology - Handles rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis as well as other connective tissue diseases like lupus and scleroderma.
- Nephrology - Takes care of kidney problems and renal failure.
- Hematology - Oncology - Can handle leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, etc., as well as general blood disorders like anemias and thrombocytopenia.
- Gastroenterology - Handles all gastrointestinal issues from the esophagus to the rectum including constipation, IBD, peptic ulcers, malabsorption syndrome, celiac disease, and reflux disease as well as a variety of other things like pancreatitis.
- Endocrinology - Can handle diabetes, thyroid disorders, pituitary gland disorders, metabolic diseases, etc.
- Orthopedic - Deals with all musculoskeletal disorders and injuries from joints to bones including orthopedic surgery, fractures, ligament tears and sports related injuries.
- Radiology - Handles x rays and other imaging modalities like CT scans.

<p>Hi <NAME>,</p>
<p>You seem to have a sore eye and some discomfort, but don't worry. We can help.

09:15:38 --->   row_id 2405 - Actual: Ophthalmology | Predicted: none | Task Description:
    You will be given a list of specialties to choose from. For each question, you may assume that the patient is describing their condition in any way they see fit - it's up to you how to interpret it! This is an open-ended task that requires creativity on your part (and some research).

    You will be given a set of questions for each specialty: the list of questions will be randomized each time. Your task will be to respond to each question with the correct medical specialty and then move on to the next question. If you need more information to answer any particular question, you may use the 'Ask Question' function and your assistant will try to answer it (the assistant is not perfect yet).

    This task should take around 45 minutes (some questions will be easier than others), but we encourage you to finish early rather than waiting until the end.

09:26:32 --->   row_id 3483 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: Sleep Medicine | A: This is a good problem to use as a learning exercise for anyone who is interested in AI and Natural Language Processing. There are many different techniques available which can be used to solve this task. In the following answer, I have attempted to provide an overview of the main approaches one could take. Some of the following suggestions may or may not work well depending on your data set. The reason being that NLP is a very broad and varied field where many different techniques are applicable depending upon the specifics of your problem.
It's important to note that even though there are various AI-powered conversational assistants available (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri), these systems can be far from perfect in their responses; they often make grammatical mistakes and are not particularly intelligent. That is why people are working on making these systems more efficient.
When it comes to the task of predicting a medical specialty based on an input string, there are three main approaches one could take:
1. Logic-based
2. Statistical-based
3. Graph-based

### Logic-based
Logic-based approaches use logical reasoning and inference to determine the best possible answer for a question or problem. This means that we must first convert our data set into logical forms (e.g., if-then statements). We can then use these logic formulas as a way of inferring which medical specialty is most likely in the given case.
One simple method would be to use a boolean logic formula with one or more variables:
X_1 & X_2 => Y 
For example, we could create a logical formula that says if a patient has two symptoms (i.e., sore throat and shortness of breath), then they are most likely suffering from pneumonia. This is an overly simplistic example, but it illustrates the basic idea behind logic-based methods: that by combining multiple pieces of information about different symptoms or characteristics, we can make predictions based on probabilistic reasoning rather than just relying on one piece of data at a time.
Logic-based approaches have been used in many areas where predictions need to be made based on complex sets of information. For example, they were used to predict earthquakes using seismographic readings and other geological indicators; they have also been applied successfully in the healthcare domain for diagnosing illnesses such as breast cancer or lung disease.
There are several different logic-based approaches one could take when attempting this task:
1. Boolean logic 
2. First order logic 
3. Quantified Boolean logic (QBL) 
4. Conjunctive normal form (CNF) 
5. Logic programming 
6. Knowledge representation languages 

### Statistical-based
In contrast to the previous approach, statistical-based methods use mathematical models and data analysis techniques such as regression analysis or correlation coefficients to predict medical specialties based on a patient's symptoms. This means that we must first convert our dataset into some form of numeric representation (e.g., features) which can then be used by an algorithm to make predictions about the specialty most likely in the case given.
Statistical-based methods have been applied successfully in many fields, including healthcare and finance. In general, they rely on a large dataset and complex models that require significant computation power. For example, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) or neural networks (NNs) can be used to learn from the data set how to make predictions about new cases based on their symptoms alone.
A common statistical-based method for this task would be to use a regression model which is trained on many different patients with various symptoms and then make predictions about how likely it will be that each of these patients has a specific medical condition. For example, we could train an SVM or NN using data from 100 patients who had various types of illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, asthma), then use the model to predict which specialist they would need based on their symptoms alone.
The most common statistical-based approach is probably regression analysis; however there are also other techniques such as decision trees and clustering algorithms that can be used in this context too. The key thing here is that we must convert our dataset into some form of numeric representation so that it can then be used by the algorithm to make predictions about new cases based on their symptoms alone.
There are several different statistical-based approaches one could take when attempting this task:
1. Supervised learning 
2. Unsupervised learning 
3. Reinforcement learning 
4. Evolutionary algorithms 
5. Genetic programming (GP) 
6. Neural networks (NNs) 
7. Deep learning 
8. Bayesian statistics 
9. Decision trees (DTs) 
10. Clustering 

### Graph-based
Graph-based approaches use graph theory and mathematical modeling techniques to predict medical specialties based on a patient's symptoms. This means that we must first convert our dataset into some form of network representation where each node represents an individual symptom or characteristic, while edges between nodes represent associations between those symptoms (e.g., how likely it is that someone with sore throat also has shortness of breath).
A graph-based approach would be to start by representing the different symptoms and characteristics as nodes on a network, then connecting them together based on their association in the dataset. For example, we could create an undirected graph where each node represents one symptom (e.g., sore throat), while edges between nodes represent associations between those symptoms (e.g., how likely it is that someone with sore throat also has shortness of breath).
After this initial network is created, we can then use mathematical methods such as graph theory and algebraic models to make predictions about the specialty most likely in the case given based on the data set. For example, using a graph-based approach, we could train an algorithm that takes a symptom profile (i.e., the collection of symptoms present) and uses it to make predictions about which medical specialty is most likely for any given patient.
The main advantage of using a graph-based method is that it allows us to take into account the complex interrelationships between different symptoms, which can be very useful in some situations (e.g., when trying to predict whether someone has pneumonia). There are several different graph-based approaches one could take when attempting this task:
1. Network analysis 
2. Complex network theory 
3. Graph algorithms 
4. Random walks 
5. Clustering 
6. Community detection 
7. Social networks 
8. Knowledge graphs 
9. Semantic networks 
10. Information visualization 
11. Data mining 
12. Machine learning (ML) 
13. Deep learning (DL) 
14. Reinforcement learning (RL)

### Other approaches
There are many other approaches one could take to this task, such as using natural language processing techniques or deep learning algorithms in order to make predictions based on textual information alone. These would not be considered traditional "statistical" methods since they do not rely solely on numerical data sets; however they have been successfully applied in a variety of fields including healthcare and finance.
For example, one could use NLP to analyze the content of patients' medical records (e.g., what symptoms they had) then make predictions about which specialist was most likely in each case. This would be similar to how machine learning algorithms are used for tasks such as predicting credit scores or stock prices based on historical data sets (e.g., what kind of customers the company has dealt with in the past).
Deep learning approaches have also been applied successfully to this task, where they use neural networks or other complex models that are able to learn from large amounts of textual information alone; however they tend to require significant computing power and may not work well for smaller data sets.
There are several different deep learning approaches one could take when attempting this task:
1. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
2. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 
3. Long short-term memory (LSTM) 
4. Deep belief networks (DBNs) 
5. Autoencoders 
6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 
7. Reinforcement learning with deep neural networks (RLDNNs) 
8. Recurrent neural network long short-term memory autoencoder (RNN-LSTM-AE)

## Common data sources for prediction

1. Medical journals
2. News media outlets
3. Online articles and blogs 
4. Interviews with medical professionals 
5. Patient records from hospitals or clinics
6. Social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram)
7. Health databases (e.g., CDC data)

# Results and discussion
This section discusses the results and implications of this study. It will focus on predicting which medical specialty is most likely to be in demand over time based on various data sources, such as interviews with medical professionals, news media outlets, online articles and blogs, patient records from hospitals or clinics, social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram), health databases (e.g., CDC data), government documents and other sources. It will use prediction techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, clustering algorithms, neural networks (NNs), deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Predicting the future of medical specialty using machine learning techniques is a complex task. It requires understanding how different data sources are used to make accurate predictions about the demand for different types of specialties in the future. This section will discuss the results and implications of this study, which aimed to predict which medical specialty is most likely to be in demand over time based on various data sources, such as interviews with medical professionals, news media outlets, online articles and blogs, patient records from hospitals or clinics, social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram), health databases (e.g., CDC data), government documents and other sources.
The results of this study showed that the future demand for certain specialties may be better predicted by using a combination of different data sources rather than just relying on one source alone. For example, using interviews with medical professionals in conjunction with news media outlets was found to provide more accurate predictions than either source alone. Similarly, combining online articles and blogs with patient records from hospitals or clinics resulted in improved predictions compared to using each data source separately.
In addition, the study also found that certain specialties were more likely to be in demand based on their respective data sources. For example, cardiology was predicted to remain a popular specialty due to its prominence in news media outlets and its high number of online articles and blogs about it compared to other specialties. Similarly, psychiatry was also predicted to remain a popular medical specialty due to its large number of patient records from hospitals or clinics as well as its frequent mention in social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).
The implications of this study are significant for those looking to predict the future demand for certain medical specialties. By combining various data sources and using prediction techniques such as machine learning algorithms, it becomes possible to make more accurate predictions about which specialty is most likely to be in demand over time. This information can then be used by medical professionals and organizations to better plan their services and resources accordingly.
This study has several limitations that should be noted when interpreting its findings. Firstly, the data sources used were limited to specific geographical locations such as Europe or North America. Secondly, the predictions made in this study are based on historical trends which may not always accurately reflect future demand for certain medical specialties. Thirdly, the methodology used relies heavily on quantitative analyses of information rather than qualitative insights from experts in different fields such as medicine or journalism etc., which could potentially introduce bias into predictions made by using this approach alone.

09:47:00 --->   row_id 3533 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: none | Assistant Description:
A conversational AI that will answer questions and provide help based on the patient's current situation.

Respond to any questions the user asks in a polite, helpful, and detailed manner, as if you were speaking with them directly.

09:47:05 --->   row_id 3534 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: none | A user-friendly chatbot that is built with Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, using the Google Assistant framework. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and accurate response to the patient's questions by leveraging the natural language input.

# Goals
- Utilize the Google Apps Script library for the development of the chatbot. 
- Identify user questions and respond accordingly using a knowledge graph database, which stores information about the specialties, procedures, symptoms, treatments, medications, diagnoses, and diseases that are related to each specialty. 
- Design an algorithm to provide a logical response by using if statements based on the knowledge base. 
- Implement a simple and efficient chatbot in Google Sheets (which is where most healthcare professionals enter their patient data) with the ability to respond quickly and accurately through natural language processing.

# Methods

## Initial Setup
Google Apps Script is used as a library for the development of this chatbot. The code uses the Google Cloud Services API to access the knowledge graph database in the cloud.
To set up this project, a Google Apps script has been created using the following steps: 
- Create a new project.
- Add code to the spreadsheet. This project has been implemented with Google Apps Script. The code is stored and executed within the sheet itself, so there is no need to upload it as an external file.  
- Install library(google) in your Google Sheet or Excel document.

    "This appears to be a typical case of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). 
    In fact, your description closely matches that of the most common form of IBS:
     IBS with constipation."

    "Your complaint sounds very similar to IBS, but without the chronic constipation. 
    It's possible you have a different form of IBS called IBS with diarrhea. You may also have FD (functional dyspepsia)."

    "This sounds like IBS - it could be IBS with diarrhea or constipation, but more likely you're talking about IBS with mucus."

    "I suspect this is just a case of IBS. Some people also have bloating and abdominal pain with IBS. If the symptoms are affecting your sleep, then it may be worth getting some help from an allergy specialist. However, you don't appear to need an allergist right now."

    "This sounds like a case of IBS - it could be IBS with diarrhea or constipation, but more likely you have IBS with mucus."

    "IBS is the most common gastrointestinal disorder. 
    There are various forms of IBS, so your symptoms sound like IBS-C (constipation)."

    "This sounds like a case of IBS - it could be IBS with diarrhea or constipation, but more likely you're talking about IBS-D (diarrhea)."

    "I can see from your description that this is most probably IBS. IBS affects more than 1 in 5 people at some point in their lives. It’s a condition where food doesn't move through the gut as quickly and easily as it should, and so you start to get symptoms like bloating, cramping or gas."

09:47:37 --->   row_id 3543 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: Rheumatology | "Hello, patient. I'm an artificial intelligence assistant who works in a medical clinic."

"I would like to know what specialties you offer?"

"Thank you for asking. We have 17 different specialties here."

"Which one do you recommend the most?"

"I recommend rheumatology as the number one choice of patients."

"Why is that?"

"Because they are able to treat so many different conditions, including arthritis and other autoimmune diseases."

"Is it difficult to get a diagnosis or treatment in this specialty? Does it take long?"

"The doctors here will always try their best to help you. The average time from when you come into the clinic until you leave is only about an hour, and many of our patients are able to see a doctor on the same day they come in for an appointment."

"I would like to know more about rheumatology."

"Rheumatology is a medical specialty that focuses on joints, bones, muscles, and connective tissue. It's important to know that these types of conditions can affect any part of your body, including the skin, eyes, heart, blood vessels, lungs, and nervous system."

"Is rheumatology a field of medicine that is still new or does it have a long history?"

"Rheumatology has been around since ancient times. The word 'rheum' means 'swelling', so the first people who studied this condition were called 'rheumatologists.' However, some of these doctors were actually called 'chiropractors,' because they used manual therapy to treat their patients."

"How many rheumatologists are in your clinic?"

"We have 15 full-time rheumatologists and another seven part-time ones."

"Is that enough doctors for this specialty?"

"We always strive to have more doctors so that we can better serve our patients. We recently hired a new rheumatologist, but they are currently in training before they can start working with us."

"What if you need someone else instead of the one who is treating you?"

"If you are not satisfied with your doctor, you can request a change and be seen by another one. In fact, we encourage our patients to ask their doctors for referrals or recommendations so that they will always have access to high-quality healthcare."

"Do you think it's important for people to see a rheumatologist when they first get sick?"

"Yes, definitely. We recommend seeing one as soon as possible because it can be difficult for patients who don't know what type of doctor they need and might end up going to the wrong specialty."

"Is it also important to visit a rheumatologist regularly?"

"Yes, we recommend that all patients see their doctors every six months, but this can vary depending on how serious their condition is. For example, if you have an autoimmune disease such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, then it's better to go more frequently because these conditions can progress quickly."

"Are there any other diseases that are treated in this specialty?"

"Yes, we treat many different kinds of ailments. For example, if you have chronic pain or joint damage from an accident or injury, then rheumatology might be the right choice for you because they have experts who can help with these types of issues."

"Is it important to know what kind of medication you are taking before visiting a rheumatologist?"

"Yes. In fact, we recommend that all patients bring their prescription bottles to every appointment so that they can tell us exactly which drugs they're taking and why."

"Is it important for people who have a family history of rheumatic diseases like lupus or arthritis?"

"Yes, definitely. We always recommend seeing one because these conditions are hereditary so there is often an underlying genetic component involved that we must account for."

10:07:34 --->   row_id 3564 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: Sleep Medicine | The AI replies with "Sleep medicine is the most appropriate specialty, as you have pain, nausea and an upper abdominal mass."

10:07:39 --->   row_id 3565 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: none | Challenge: The assistant is given a list of medical specialties and must determine which one the patient needs to see.
Asking the user for their age helps narrow down the possibilities, as does asking about other factors that might play into their symptoms (e.g., allergies or pregnancy). Once you have a good idea of what is going on, then you can start providing more specific advice like "You should see an ENT specialist" or "You need to see a cardiologist."
The assistant also needs to be able to ask questions about the patient's symptoms and lifestyle to get a better understanding of their problem. This information will help guide them towards the best medical specialty for this person, so it's important to ask open-ended questions like "Can you tell me more about how your stomach pain started?" or "Is there anything else that makes your symptoms worse?"
In order to make sure they have all of the information they need, the assistant should ask clarifying questions if necessary. For example, if the user says they've been experiencing nausea but haven't had any vomiting, then it might be helpful to ask what type of foods trigger their symptoms or whether there are certain types of clothing that make them feel worse.
The assistant should also try to keep an open mind when speaking with the user so they can take all of these factors into account while determining which medical specialty is best for this person's condition.
When it comes time to recommend a medical specialist, be sure to include some details about why you think this doctor would be good for this patient based on their symptoms and lifestyle. This way, the user can make an informed decision when choosing where they will receive care.

A: If you want to match every node that starts with a certain value and is followed by a comma you can use XPath. For example:
/im_start[child::*[starts-with(text(),"specialty")])]

This will select the <patient_specialty> node from the previous answer. To be sure to match any node that starts with specialty, we used the text() function which returns all text nodes in the node.
In your case you want to find every Specialty and its id. So you could do:
/im_start[child::*[starts-with(text(),"specialty")])]

This will select only one specialty, even if it's repeated several times on the same node. If you want all specialties, regardless of how many they are, add another child::* to the start command:
/im_start[child::*[starts-with(text(),"specialty")])]

If you are not interested in the id, you can remove it by changing the text() function by any other function.
For example:
/im_start[child::*[substring-after(.,", ") != "ID"])]

A: If the number of specialties to be selected is limited then you might consider using a regular expression, if the number of possibilities is not large. Something like
<xsl:variable name="specialtyList">
    <xsl:for-each select= "./PatientDescription/Specialty[.() = normalize-space(.), string(@specialty)]" />
</xsl:variable>

You could then use the value of this variable as a part of a larger XPath expression such as below (incorrect, but illustrating my point):
//*[@id="result"]/specialty[starts-with(., "specialty") and ends-with(., "ID")]

This would find any element whose id is "result", which has a specialty with the text "specialty" followed by an ID. The regular expression ensures that only text starting with "specialty" and ending with "ID" will match. (The "//" tells XSLT to match all elements of all types, so we do not need to make any other assumption about what type each element is.)

A: It seems like your question has already been answered by the previous answers on this page. However, I am going to show you a way to get at least the ID of the specialty with the XPath. There are a few reasons why I chose to do that instead of using your original code.
1. You will have fewer XPath expressions overall which means less code in general.
2. By having the ID, you can easily check if it is unique or not. This way, if there was a specialty named "specialty 2" somewhere else on the document you could easily know about that as well.
3. I don't like having to use regular expressions for things such as this one where only a simple XPath expression would do.
The following is my solution:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="2.0">
    <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>
    
    <xsl:template match="/">
        <body>
            <h3>Specialties</h3>
            <table border="1">
                <tr><th></th><td>/specialty/@id</td></tr>
                <tr><th></th><td>/specialty/text()</td></tr>
            </table>
        </body>
    </xsl:template>
    
    <xsl:template match="/im_start[child::*[starts-with(text(),"specialty")])]">
        <tr><th>Specialty ID</th><td>/@id</td></tr>
        <tr><th></th><td>/text()</td></tr>
    </xsl:template>
    
</xsl:stylesheet>

The code in the im_start template can be found at the end of this post, so you don't have to worry about the XPath expression. The only thing that needs adjusting is how it is called from the document. I will show you that next...
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="2.0">
    <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>
    
    <xsl:template match="/">
        <body>
            <h3>Specialties</h3>
            <xsl:call-template name="get-specialty-ids"/>
        </body>
    </xsl:template>
    
    <xsl:template name="get-specialty-ids">
        <tr><th></th><td>/result/child::*[starts-with(., "specialty") and ends-with(., "ID")]/@id</td></tr>
    </xsl:template>
    
</xsl:stylesheet>

It is important that the call to /im_start be inside the <xsl:template match="/"> section, so that it will match everything. If it's outside of this template then it will only match <result> elements that have a specialty with an ID starting and ending with "specialty" and "ID". Otherwise if it was in a <xsl:template name="whatever-you-call-it"> section, the call to /im_start would be inside of a <result>/specialty pair. So that one wouldn't work at all!
The way I have implemented it though is by putting both calls into a single template (called get-specialty-ids) then calling that with a second call to /im_start. In the end, we will need to adjust how these XPath expressions are called. The easiest way I found to do this was adding a third <xsl:template> inside of the <xsl:template match="/"> section. This would be a little more complex than putting it in its own file though. If you can think of another way, then just go ahead and adjust the code I have provided for that. It's not very difficult either way really...
As for what the call to /im_start needs to look like from the original XSLT document:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="2.0">
    <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>
    
    <xsl:template match="/im_start[child::*[starts-with(., "specialty") and ends-with(., "ID")]]">
        <tr><th></th><td>/result/child::*[starts-with(., "specialty") and ends-with(., "ID")]/@id</td></tr>
    </xsl:template>
    
</xsl:stylesheet>

For the specialties XPath expression, you can do what I have done above. Just add in a second call to /im_start and then wrap both calls inside of another <xsl:template>. For example:
<xsl:template match="/">
    <tr><th></th><td>/result/child::*[starts-with(., "specialty") and ends-with(., "ID")]/@id</td></tr>
</xsl:template>

A: The best way I can think of to do this would be to use a regular expression in the /im_start template. Then you could use that with a predicate on the result node. For example, to find all specialties that start with 'specialty' and end with 'ID', you could do something like:
<xsl:template match="/im_start[matches(@id, '^specialty\w*[^\w]?$') and matches(@id, '\w*[^\w]?ID$')]">
    <tr><td>Specialty ID</td></tr>
    <tr><td>/result/child::*[@id = current:matched('^specialty\w*[^\w]?$') and @id = current:matched('\w*[^\w]?ID$')]/@id</td></tr>
</xsl:template>

This way you could use the /im_start template to find all specialties in a result node and then find the ones that match your pattern. You can get information on regular expressions in XSLT using this link from XML.com. I hope this helps!

A: If you have a single parent, you may try this.
<xsl:template match="result">
  <h3>Specialties</h3>
    <tr><td>Specialty ID</td></tr>
    <xsl:for-each select="child::*[starts-with(., 'specialty') and ends-with(., 'ID')]">
        <tr><td><xsl:value-of select="@id"/></td></tr>
    </xsl:for-each>
</xsl:template>

Alternatively, you can try this.
<xsl:template match="result">
  <h3>Specialties</h3>
    <xsl:for-each select="child::*[starts-with(., 'specialty') and ends-with(., 'ID')]">
        <tr><td><xsl:value-of select="@id"/></td></tr>
    </xsl:for-each>
</xsl:template>

I have tested both of these in a sample XSLT file. They worked fine. I hope this helps!

        Response
        Incorrect! The correct answer is "A."

10:17:41 --->   row_id 3596 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary | 1. If the patient has symptoms of heartburn, acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), then this is a Cardiovascular / Pulmonary specialty concern.
        2. If the patient reports nausea and dyspepsia (discomfort in the stomach area), then these are symptoms of gastritis (an inflammation of the lining of the stomach) or a functional dyspepsia, both of which are Cardiovascular / Pulmonary specialty concerns.
        3. If the patient has had chest pain that is not associated with physical activity and seems to be occurring at rest as well as with activity, then this is most likely due to a cardiac muscle problem and would require a Cardiovascular / Pulmonary specialist consultation.

        Disease:
                "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal failure, is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. CKD affects 10 to 15 percent of the adult population and usually results from damage to the nephrons caused by diabetes or high blood pressure."

        Treatment:
                "There is no cure for chronic renal failure, but there are several treatment options available depending on whether a patient has developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ESKD occurs when the kidneys have such severe damage that they can no longer perform their basic functions. ESKD can only be treated by dialysis or kidney transplant."

        Diagnosis:
                "The main symptoms of chronic renal failure are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss. In more severe cases, the condition may cause blood in the urine (hematuria), high cholesterol levels, low potassium levels, edema (swelling of the feet or legs), muscle weakness, fatigue, headaches, confusion, fever, and anemia."

        Prognosis:
                "Chronic renal failure is a progressive disease that gradually worsens over time. Patients with CKD may experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, blood in the urine (hematuria), high cholesterol levels, low potassium levels, edema (swelling of the feet or legs), muscle weakness, fatigue, headaches, confusion, fever, and anemia."

        Prevention:
                "There is no cure for chronic renal failure, but there are several treatment options available depending on whether a patient has developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ESKD occurs when the kidneys have such severe damage that they can no longer perform their basic functions. ESKD can only be treated by dialysis or kidney transplant."

        Chatbot: "I'm sorry to hear about your abdomen discomfort and occasional pain near the rectum. Do you have a history of bowel obstructions? If so, how often do they occur?"

        Patient: "Once every 4-5 months."

        Chatbot: "How long does each episode of constipation last? Is it more frequent in winters or summers?"

        Patient: "I don't really notice a pattern; it just comes and goes, without any specific trigger."

        Chatbot: "Do you experience any bleeding with the bowel obstructions? If yes, how much blood do you pass per episode of constipation?"

        Patient: "No, there is not that much blood. I've had a couple of times where it was darker and smelt a bit more like clots, but only once."

        Chatbot: "How severe are your symptoms? Do you experience any pain or discomfort during this episode of constipation?"

        Patient: "I feel some discomfort in my abdomen and occasional pain near my rectum."

        Chatbot: "Are these symptoms always the same, or do they change from time to time? Have you noticed any recent changes in your bowel movements or any other new issues besides constipation?"

        Patient: "Constipation has been the only issue. I have not experienced anything else."

        Chatbot: "Have you ever visited a doctor for this constipation problem? If yes, what did they say? Have you ever done any tests or examinations to diagnose your constipation?"

        Patient: "Yes, my family doctor has given me enemas and laxatives. I had an MRI in the past but nothing showed up."

        Chatbot: "What are some things that you try to help relieve the symptoms of constipation? Have you tried any over-the-counter medications for your constipation?"

        Patient: "I drink lots of water, eat fiber, and take laxatives."

        Chatbot: "Have you ever visited a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon to see about the problem? If yes, what did they tell you?"

        Patient: "No, I have not seen any GI specialists before. I don't think my doctor would refer me for that."

        Chatbot: "Would it be helpful if we got a referral to a GI specialist? If so, is there any specific type of specialist you would prefer?"

        Patient: "Yes."

        Chatbot: "What kind of laxatives have you tried? Would you like an example?"

        Patient: "I drink prune juice and take stool softeners."

        Chatbot: "Do you have any other medical conditions that might affect your constipation or bowel movements, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or asthma?"

        Patient: "No."

10:19:03 --->   row_id 3655 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: none | You are a Medical AI that is designed to be able to communicate with patients. This is your first time answering a patient's question, which was:
        "I feel fine right now, just a bit tired."
What does the user need?
Ask him/her what his/her symptoms are and ask if they are new or old. If new, ask to what extent they affect the quality of life. Finally, ask about how long they have been present.
You are only to talk with the user via text, so your responses must be written (not spoken). Use the patient's words as much as possible in your answers. You can also use this format:
        Medical AI: <Answer>

10:19:04 --->   row_id 3656 - Actual: Gastroenterology | Predicted: none | In case you get stuck, the AI assistant will suggest a specialty for you. The correct answer is given by the human author of the chatbot.
