What should AI triage do (front-desk nurse)?
The nurse’s job is to extract enough context from the patient’s complaints to either:
1️⃣ Send them to the right specialty (if the problem is clear-cut, e.g., skin rash → dermatology), or
2️⃣ Escalate to emergency care if it sounds urgent (e.g., stroke symptoms, heart attack symptoms).

What questions should AI Triage ask:
1. Chief Complaint / Main Concern
   a. What symptoms are you experiencing?
   b. Where is the pain or problem?
2. Symptom Details
   a. When did it start?
   b. How severe is it? (mild, moderate, severe)
   c. Is it constant or does it come and go?
3. Associated Symptoms
   a. Do you have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, numbness, vomiting, or diarrhea?
4. Past Medical History
   a. Do you have any health conditions that might be related to this problem? (like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease if chest pain is the complaint)
4. Medications & Allergies
   a. Are you currently taking any medications?
   b. Do you have any allergies?
