0,A 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.

He has remained azoospermic postoperatively.  The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal.,He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife.  Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful.,At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation.  At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest.  I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately.  At his initial request, Month DD, YYYY was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting, although this may change if you require fresh specimen.,Thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him.,Sample Doctor, M.D.",Urology

Intraoperatively, the bladder appeared normal with the exception of some minor trabeculations.  The ureteral orifices were normal bilaterally.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  This patient was brought to the operating room, a general anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Her vulva, vagina, and perineum were prepped with Betadine scrubbed in solution.  She was draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Sims retractor was placed into the vagina and Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder.  Two Allis clamps were placed over the mid urethra.  This area was injected with 0.50% lidocaine containing 1:200,000 epinephrine solution.  Two areas suprapubically on either side of midline were injected with the same anesthetic solution.  The stab wound incisions were made in these locations and a sagittal incision was made over the mid urethra.

51,Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prostate cancer.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 450 mL.,REPLACEMENT:,  250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: , This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate.  Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",Urology

The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.",Urology

68,Penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration.,"REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding.  He is otherwise healthy.  He tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago.  He told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble.  Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there.  He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has.  Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out.  He was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs.  So, he was brought to the hospital.  Actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood.  He came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis.  The marble also still can be felt underneath the skin.  There is no urethral bleeding.  He did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria.  There is pain in the lacerations.  No erythema in the skin or swelling in the penis and no other injuries.

72,Right undescended testicle.  Orchiopexy & Herniorrhaphy.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right undescended testicle.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right undescended testicle.,OPERATIONS:,1.  Right orchiopexy.,2.  Right herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Sac.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis.  The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions.",Urology
73,Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria.,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder.  Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable.  She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night.  No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms.  The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well.  At this point, what we will try is a different medication.  Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease.,IMPRESSION: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted.  She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued.  At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication.  She has never had any side effects from her medication.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue Ditropan.  We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled.

When they removed the catheter they forgot to reduce the foreskin and he developed paraphimosis.  The plan is for reduction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, with manual pressure and mobilization of the shaft skin we were able to reduce the paraphimosis.  Using Betadine and alcohol cleanse, we then did a dorsal penile block and a ring block by surgeon with 0.25% Marcaine, 20 mL were given.  He did quite well after the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",Urology
76,Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right undescended testis (ectopic position).,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Right undescended testis (ectopic position), right inguinal hernia.,PROCEDURES: , Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair.,ANESTHESIA:,  General inhalational anesthetic with caudal block.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,100 mL of crystalloids.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 5 mL.,SPECIMENS:,  No tissues sent to pathology.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is an almost 4-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the right; plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room; surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments.  As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top.  We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps.  Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction.  We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal.  Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision.  IV Toradol was given.  Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.",Urology
79,Orchiopexy & inguinal herniorrhaphy.,"OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.

The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic.  Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam.  There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.  Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution.  The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.",Urology

Left testicular abscess.,3.  Necrotic testes.,SURGERY:,  Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy.,DRAINS:,  Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum.,The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000.  The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.  The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.",Urology

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.",Urology
89,An example/template for meatoplasty.,"OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.  At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis.  There was good hemostasis and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.",Urology

The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.

The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5.  In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above.  His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar.  He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms.  This has been ongoing for greater than five years.  No other associated symptoms or modifying factors.  Severity is moderate.  PSA relatively stable over time.,IMPRESSION: , Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms.  After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased.  At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification.  There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).,ANESTHESIA: , General laryngeal mask.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 61-year-old white male who has been treated at the VA in Houston for a bladder cancer.  His history dates back to 2003 when he had a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  He had multiple cystoscopies and followups since that time with no evidence of recurrence.  However, on recent cystoscopy, he had what appeared to be a recurrent tumor and was taken to the operating room and had this resected with findings of a Ta grade III transitional cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma in situ.  Retrograde pyelograms were suspicious on the right and cleared with ureteroscopy and the left renal pelvic washing was positive but this may represent contamination from the lower urinary tract as radiographically, there were no abnormalities.  I had cystoscoped the patient in the office showed during the period of time when he had significant irritative burning symptoms, and there were still healing biopsy sites.  We elected to allow his bladder to recover before starting the BCG.  We were ready to do that last week but two doctors and a nurse including myself were unable to pass Foley catheter.  I repeated a cystoscopy in the office with findings of a high bladder neck and BPH.  After a lengthy discussion with the patient and his wife, we elected to proceed with TURP after a full informed consent.,FINDINGS: , At cystoscopy, there was bilobular prostatic hyperplasia and a very high riding bladder neck, which may have been the predominant cause of his difficulty catheterizing and obstructive symptoms.  There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall in the midline suspicious for carcinoma in situ.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings as described.  We removed the cystoscope and passed a #28 French continuous flow resectoscope sheath under visual obturator after dilating the meatus to #32 French with van Buren sounds.  Inspection of bladder again was made noting the location of the ureteral orifices relative to the bladder neck.  The groove was cut at 6 o'clock to open the bladder neck to verumontanum and then the left lobe was resected from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  Hemostasis was achieved, and then a similar procedure performed in the right side.  We resected the anterior stromal tissue and the apical tissue and then obtained complete hemostasis.  Chips were removed with Ellik evacuator.  There was no bleeding at the conclusion of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed.  A #24 French three-way Foley catheter was placed with efflux of clear irrigant.

The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system.  Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed.  A semirigid ureteroscopy was done.  A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter.  Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces.  Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed.  Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative.  There were no further stones.  Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal.  The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent.  There were no further stones.  Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours.  Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed.  There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

These were discussed at length.  Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.

Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.  The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room.

Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock.  The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges.  Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure.  Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied.  The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",Urology

Needles, 24.,BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: , This is a 57-year-old male who was seen by us for elevated PSA.  The patient had a prostate biopsy with T2b disease, Gleason 6.  Options such as watchful waiting, robotic prostatectomy, seed implantation with and without radiation were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, rectal dysfunction, voiding issues, burning pain, unexpected complications such as fistula, rectal injury, urgency, frequency, bladder issues, need for chronic Foley for six months, etc., were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications.  The patient has history of urethral stricture.  The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had SCDs on.  The patient was given preop antibiotics.  The patient had done bowel prep the day before.  Transrectal ultrasound was performed.  The prostate was measured at about 32 gm.  The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc.  Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed.  Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient.  There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid.  Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate.  A total of 24 needles was used.  Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra.  Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed.  There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound.  There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position.  Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy.  Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure.  Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter.  The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture.  Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame.  We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in.  At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized.  The stricture was wide open.  The prostate was slightly enlarged.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder.  The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens.  At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed.  The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures.  The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed.  The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home.,The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.",Urology

During the course of the procedure, a bladder laceration was notices and urology was consulted.  Findings were a laceration on the dome of the bladder.,PROCEDURE: , Initially there as a mucosal layer of suture already placed.  This was done with 3-0 chromic catgut.  The bladder was distended and, while the bladder was distended with physiologic saline, a second layer of 3-0 chromic catgut created a watertight closure.  The second layer included the mucosa an dinner layer of the detrusor muscle.  A third layer of 2-0 Dexon was used.  Each of these were placed in a continuous running-locked suture technique.  There was complete watertight closure of the bladder.  Hemostasis was assured and a Jackson-Pratt drain was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The remaining portion of the operation, both the cesarean section and the wound closure, will be dictated by Dr. Redmond.",Urology
172,Bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today’s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday’s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.",Urology
176,Bilateral vasovasostomy surgery sample.,"Initially a small incision was made in the right superior hemiscrotum and the incision was carried down to the vas deferens.  This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy.  A towel clip was placed around this.  Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally.  Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up.  Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue.  Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends.  Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully.  After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed.  Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen.  This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.  Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures.  A good reapproximation was noted.  Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.,There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum.  The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.,Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.  Antibiotic ointment, fluffs, and a scrotal support were placed.",Urology

The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency.  Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed.  Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc.  Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed.  Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.  The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.,The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months.  The patient understood.  The patient was to follow up as an outpatient.",Urology
1460,Chronic snoring in children,"CHRONIC SNORING,Chronic snoring in children can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea or upper airway resistant syndrome.  Both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system.  Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue, hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions.  In addition, the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.,In this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy.  It is therefore indicated and medically necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation.  A two week sleep diary will be given to the parents to fill out daily before the polysomnogram is performed.",Sleep Medicine
1462,The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram.,"The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram on 09/22/06 and the details of the polysomnographic study are reported separately.  The highlights of the study include the following:,A.  Obstructive apneas and hypopneas were identified with an overall apnea-hypopnea index of 15.2 events per hour in the supine position.  All events occurred in the supine position and were more prominent during stage REM sleep.  Minimum oxygen saturation was 88%.,B.  Periodic limb movements in sleep were identified with an overall index of 32 events per hour of sleep.,C.  The patient's sleep efficiency was reduced to 89.2%.  There was significant sleep fragmentation due to the obstructive apneas and hypopneas as well as due to the periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  The patient did not achieve any stage III/IV sleep and stage REM sleep was diminished at 12.7%.  There was a corresponding increase in stage I sleep and stage II sleep at 10.8% and 65.7% respectively.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,1.  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, supine position dependent, moderate (780.53-0).,2.  Periodic limb movement in sleep disorder, moderate (780.53-4).,CASE DISCUSSION: , Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in the care of the patient here at the Sleep Clinic.,The patient exhibits obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death.  Furthermore, patients with this condition are susceptible to excessive daytime sleepiness while driving and there is a higher incidence of automobile accident.  The patient should be warned with regards to these possibilities.,Patients with this condition can be successfully treated with nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), so that the patient should return to the sleep laboratory for repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration.  The sleep laboratory if necessary can introduce the patient to the proper use of the CPAP equipment and to determine a necessary pressure to prevent apneas.,It is reported that the patient undergo careful ENT/maxillofacial evaluation by a physician familiar with sleep disorders.  Anatomical abnormalities in the upper airway often cause or predispose to this condition.  Surgical intervention may be helpful or necessary if such conditions exist.  Alternatively, ________ may be of benefit in some patients depending upon the anatomical abnormalities.,Obstructive sleep apnea is worsened by obesity.  The patient should be encouraged to lose weight.  Patients usually lose weight more effectively when involved in a behavioral weight loss program.  It is sometimes difficult for patients to lose weight until the OSA is adequately treated because excessive daytime sleepiness results in decreased physical activity in the daytime.,Patient may have worsening obstructive sleep apnea by nasal airway obstruction and nasal congestion.  If present, these conditions should be treated.  In addition, any home allergens such as pets, down bedding or other factors should be removed from the sleep environment.,The patient should be informed that obstructive sleep apnea may be worsened by the use of alcohol or sedative medications particularly taken in the evening.  Therefore, the evening use of sedative medications and alcohol are to be avoided.,The patient also exhibits periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  This may require treatment.  However, it will be appropriate to obtain the repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration to see if the PLMS continues to be troublesome.  If so, treatment recommendations will be made.",Sleep Medicine
1471,Electroencephalographic findings and interpretation,"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.",Sleep Medicine
1475,A sample note on Rheumatoid Arthritis,"RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, (or RA) is a chronic, systemic condition with primary involvement of the joints.  Joint inflammation is present due to an abnormal immune response in which the body attacks its own tissue.  Specifically, the tissues lining the joint are involved as well as cartilage and muscle and sometimes the eyes and blood vessels.  The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is obscure but it is associated with a family history, genetic and autoimmune problems, people ages 20-60, female gender 3:1 or a Native American background.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Joint pain, swelling, redness, warmth.  Commonly involved joints are the small joints of the hands and feet and the ankles, wrists, knees, shoulders and elbows.,*  Multiple swollen joints (more than 3) with simultaneous involvement of same joints on opposite side of the body.,*  Morning stiffness that lasts longer than 30 minutes.,*  Difficulty making a fist; poor grip strength.,*  Night pain.,*  Feeling ""sick"" - low fever, loss of appetite, tiredness, generalized aching and stiffness, weakness.,*  Rheumatoid nodules under the skin, usually along the surface of tendons or over bony prominences.,*  Disease may lead to deformed joints, decreased vision, anemia, muscle weakness, peripheral nerve problems, pericarditis, enlarged spleen, increased frequency of infections.,*  Blood tests will reveal a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) to be present the majority of the time.,TREATMENT:,*  To diagnose RA, blood studies are done to detect a substance known as rheumatoid factor and x-rays may show typical findings.,*  Night splints for involved joints.

Two weeks later she saw a nephrologist at ABCDE were she worked at that time.  An ultrasound revealed that she had Parenchymal disease in which tissue around the kidney is diseased.  No particular treatment was advised.  She was laid off 6 months later.  In 2004, she began working at The ABCD Hospital and began seeing Dr. A.  She was put on Procrit, but could not keep the stringent appointment scheduled for the injection because of her work.  She began seeing Dr. B and was put on Procrit and Renagel.  She was advised to go on dialysis, but she felt she did not have enough information to such a drastic step.  She saw an endocrinologist for some thyroid problem and her blood work showed that her creatinine was now at 7.  She was referred to Dr. Xyz who found after a parathyroid scan that she may have an adenoma.  Her creatinine is now 7.4.,TREATMENT AND IMPACT OF DISEASE:,  She is on several medications.

1761,Psychological Testing for ADHD,"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:,  Mr. Abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a depression, or a Bipolar Spectrum Disorder.  The information will be used for treatment planning.,BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Mr. Abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  He has been married since 1995 and lost a son to SIDS over seven years ago.  He served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at UAA.  He still wants to get a degree in engineering.  Mr. Abcd indicated that he did use THC at the time of his initial intake with me in January 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as I am aware.  He has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife's significant health problems.  He also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  He has received counseling in the past, and did try both Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in October 2005.  He indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  He indicated that he thought he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  There is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  A recent stressor involved OCS involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for THC.  So far as I am aware, this case is closed at this time.  ,BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:,  Mr. Abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  Mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  Affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  Speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  He was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  The results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed.,ASSESSMENT RESULTS:,  Mr. Abcd's responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F'+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  Posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the MMPI-2.,SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:,",Psychiatry / Psychology

1788,Psychiatric Consultation of patient with recurring depression.,"CC: , ""Five years ago, I stopped drinking and since that time, I have had severe depression.  I was doing okay when I stopped my medications in April for a few weeks, but then I got depressed again.  I started lithium three weeks ago."",HPI:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old married white female without children currently working as a billing analyst for Northwest Natural.  The patient has had one psychiatric hospitalization for seven days in April of 1999.  The patient now presents with recurrent depressive symptoms for approximately four months.  The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite.  The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal.  The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her.  The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth.  She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done.  The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent.  She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times.  She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him.  She reports no history of abuse in the past.  The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them ""cracking down on me."" The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels ""abandoned."" The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.  When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply.  It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation.  The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization.  The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night.  At present, the patient's mood is reactive and for much of the session she appears angry and irritated with me but at the end of the session, after I have given her my assessment, she appears calmed and not depressed.  When asked if she is suicidal at present, she states no.  The patient does not want to go into the hospital.  The patient also indicates at the end of the session she felt hopeful.  The patient reports her current sleep is about eight hours per night.  She states that longest she has been able to stay awake in the past has been 24 hours.  She states that during periods where she feels up she sleeps perhaps six hours per night.  The patient reports no spending sprees and no reports no sexual indiscretions.  The patient states that her sexuality does increase when she is feeling better but not enormously so.  The patient denies any history of delusions or hallucinations.  The patient denies any psychosis.  The patient states that she does have mood swings and that the upstate lasts for a couple of weeks at longest.  She states that more predominately she has depression.  The patient states that she does not engage in numerous projects when she is in an upstate although does imagine doing so.

We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).,Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.",Psychiatry / Psychology

Starting from the left side local anesthetic was used for skin wheal just lateral superior to the 10 o'clock position of the lateral aspect of the T11 pedicle on the left.  The 13-gauge needle and trocar were then taken and placed to 10 o'clock position on the pedicle.  At this point using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle and trocar were advanced into the vertebral body using the fluoroscopic images and making sure that the needle was lateral to the medial wall of the pedicle of the pedicle at all times.  Once the vertebral body was entered then using lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle was advanced to the junction of the anterior one third and posterior two thirds of the body.  At this point polymethylmethacrylate was mixed for 60 seconds.  Once the consistency had hardened and the __________ was gone, incremental dose of the cement were injected into the vertebral body.  It was immediately seen that the cement was going cephalad into the vertebral body and was exiting through the crack in the vertebra.  A total 1.2 cc of cement was injected.  On lateral view, the cement crushed to the right side as well.  There was some dye infiltration into the disk space.  There was no dye taken whatsoever into the posterior aspect of the epidural space or intrathecal canal.,At this point, as the needle was slowly withdrawn under lateral fluoroscopic images, visualization was maintained to ensure that none of the cement was withdrawn posteriorly into the epidural space.

A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed.  Drill hole was made in the distal femur.  The size to an E, right.  Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side.  This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made.  Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out.  There was excellent resection.  It was flat.  Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  Appropriate cuts were carried out.  The standard cut was utilized.,The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws.  Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made.  The cutting guide was then removed.  The bone was removed.  Excess bone was taken out posteriorly.  The posterior capsule was loosened up.  There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened.  Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner.  An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held.  A cut was carried out parallel to the foot.  Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella.  The patella was isolated.  Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off.  The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  The tibial guide was then pinned.  Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella.

2028,"Total hip arthroplasty on the left.  Left hip degenerative arthritis.  Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Total hip arthroplasty on the left.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS: , 800 cc.,The patient was positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag.,IMPLANT SPECIFICATION: , A 54 mm Trilogy cup with cluster holes 3 x 50 mm diameter with a appropriate liner, a 28 mm cobalt-chrome head with a zero neck length head, and a 12 mm porous proximal collared femoral component.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.  The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.",Orthopedic

After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.

Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline.

Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS: , This patient developed a compartment syndrome.  She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",Orthopedic

Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot.,2.  Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.

After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.

2049,Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion repair.,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic.,Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution.  A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed.,We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution.  An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint.,We found that the articular surface was in good condition.

The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.",Orthopedic
2064,A sample note on RICE Therapy,"RICE, stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation.,REST:,Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing.,ICE:,Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways:,*  For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve.,*  For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place.,*  Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes.,*  Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes.,*  Reapply the ice.,*  Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable.,COMPRESSION:,Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury:,*  Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time.,*  Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site.,*  Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time.,ELEVATION:,Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.",Orthopedic

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.  The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  She should continue toe touch weightbearing on her leg.  The wound may be wet in approximately 5 days.  The patient should follow up in clinic in about 10 days.

2081,Pain management sample progress note.,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.

2083,Pain management for post-laminectomy low back syndrome and radiculopathy.,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.

The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.  Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes.  Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left.  There is no ankle clonus.  Babinski is negative.  Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution.  Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5.  Ankle extensors are -3 on the left and +5 on the right.  Dorsiflexors of the left ankle are +2 on the left and +5 on the right.  Straight leg raising test is positive on the left at about 35 .  There is no ankle clonus.  Hoffman's test and Tinel's test are normal in the upper extremities.,Respiratory:  Breath sounds normal.  Trachea is midline.,Cardiovascular:  Heart sounds normal.  No gallops or murmurs heard.  Carotid pulses present.  No carotid bruits.  Peripheral pulses are palpable.,Abdomen:  Hernia site is intact.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.

Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.,4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.",Orthopedic

In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart.  She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She was counseled on smoking cessation.  She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.

2088,Patient with back and hip pain.,"Chief Complaint:, Back and hip pain.,History of Present Illness:, The patient is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy / restriction of bladder neck requiring hemodialysis and eventual cadaveric renal transplant now on chronic immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease with non-healing ulcer of right great toe, and peripheral neuropathy who initially presented to his primary care physician in May 2001 with complaints of low back pain and bilateral hip pain. The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

The patient was in early stage of gestation.  Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape.,Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced.  A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction.  A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected.  Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius.  The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy.  A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole.  Antral awl was inserted.  Then we reamed the canal to size 2.  Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal.  Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally.  The second dorsal incision was made.  The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed.  Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius.  Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius.  At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers.  Sterile dressing applied.  The patient then was extubated and transferred to the recovery room under stable condition.,Postoperatively, the patient will see a therapist within five days.

2104,Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Comminuted left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with intraarticular extension.,PROCEDURE:,  Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.  The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,DRAINS: , One JP drain was placed.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications or specimens.  Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOP PLAN:  ,The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.  The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case.",Orthopedic

He was then scheduled for I&D and excision of the bursa.  Risks and benefits were discussed.  No guarantees were made or implied.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate sedation was achieved, the left elbow was injected with 0.25% plain Marcaine.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  On examination of the left elbow, there was presence of thickening of the bursal sac.  There was a couple of millimeter opening of skin breakdown from where the serous drainage was noted.  An incision was made midline of the olecranon bursa with an elliptical incision around the open wound, which was excised with skin.  The incision was carried proximally and distally.  The olecranon bursa was significantly thickened and scarred.  Excision of the olecranon bursa was performed.  There was significant evidence of thickening of the bursa with some evidence of adhesions.  Satisfactory olecranon bursectomy was performed.  The wound margins were debrided.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac irrigation lavage system mixed with antibiotic solution.  There was no evidence of a loose body.  There was no bleeding or drainage.  After completion of the bursectomy and I&D, the skin margins, which were excised were approximated with 2-0 nylon in horizontal mattress fashion.  The open area of the skin, which was excised was left _________ and was dressed with 0.25-inch iodoform packing.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.

She is under the care of Dr. Bonaparte for hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism.  She has a long history of back and neck pain with multiple injuries in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  In 2000, she developed ""sciatica"" mostly in her right lower extremity.,She is seen today with no outside imaging, except with MRI of her cervical spine and lumbar spine dated February of 2004.  Her cervical MRI reveals an 8 mm central spinal canal at C6-7, multilevel foraminal stenosis, though her report is not complete as we do not have all the pages.  Her lumbar MRI reveals lumbar spinal stenosis at L4-5 with multilevel facet arthropathy and spondylitic changes.,The patient has essentially three major pain complaints.,Her first pain complaint is one of a long history of axial neck pain without particular radicular symptoms.  She complains of popping, clicking, grinding and occasional stiffness in her neck, as well as occasional periscapular pain and upper trapezius myofascial pain and spasms with occasional cervicalgic headaches.  She has been told by Dr. Megahed in the past that she is not considered a surgical candidate.  She has done physical therapy twice as recently as three years ago for treatment of her symptoms.  She complains of occasional pain and stiffness in both hands, but no particular numbness or tingling.,Her next painful complaint is one of midthoracic pain and thoracalgia features with some right-sided rib pain in a non-dermatomal distribution.  Her rib pain was not preceded by any type of vesicular rash and is reproducible, though is not made worse with coughing.  There is no associated shortness of breath.  She denies inciting trauma and also complains of pain along the costochondral and sternochondral junctions anteriorly.  She denies associated positive or negative sensory findings, chest pain or palpitations, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, or sputum production.  Her weight has been stable without any type of constitutional symptoms.,Her next painful complaint is one of axial low back pain with early morning pain and stiffness, which improves somewhat later in the day.  She complains of occasional subjective weakness to the right lower extremity.  Her pain is worse with sitting, standing and is essentially worse in the supine position.  Five years ago, she developed symptoms radiating in an L5-S1 distribution and within the last couple of years, began to develop numbness in the same distribution.  She has noted some subjective atrophy as well of the right calf.  She denies associated bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, or falls.  She has treated her back symptoms with physical therapy as well.,She is intolerant to any type of antiinflammatory medications as well and has a number of allergies to multiple medications.

She has chronic osteoarthritic changes evident over both hands.  There is mild restriction of range of motion of the right shoulder, but no active impingement signs.,Inspection of the axial skeleton reveals a cervicothoracic head-forward posture with slight internal rotation of the upper shoulders.  Palpation of the axial skeleton reveals mild midline tenderness at the lower lumbar levels one fingerbreadth lateral to the midline.  There is no midline spinous process tenderness over the cervicothoracic regions.  Palpation of the articular pillars is met with mild provocation of pain.  Palpation of the right posterior, posterolateral and lateral borders of the lower ribs is met with mild provocable tenderness.  There is also tenderness at the sternochondral and costochondral junctions of the right, as well as the left bilaterally.  The xiphoid process is not particularly tender.  There is no dermatomal sensory abnormality in the thoracic spine appreciated.  Mild facetal features are evident over the sacral spine with extension and lateral bending at the level of the sacral ala.,Neurological examination of the upper and lower extremities reveals 3/5 reflexes of the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and patellar bilaterally.  I cannot elicit S1 reflexes.  There are no long tract signs.  Negative Hoffman's, negative Spurling's, no clonus, and negative Babinski.  Motor examination of the upper, as well as lower extremities appears to be intact throughout.  I may be able to detect a slight hand of atrophy of the right calf muscles, but this is truly unclear and no measurement was made.,SUMMARY OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:,  As per above.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Osteoarthritis.,2.  Cervical spinal stenosis.,3.  Lumbar spinal stenosis.,4.  Lumbar radiculopathy, mostly likely at the right L5-S1 levels.,5.  History of mild spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine at L4-L5 and right sacroiliac joint dysfunction.,6.  Chronic pain syndrome with myofascial pain and spasms of the trapezius and greater complexes.,PLAN:  ,The natural history and course of the disease was discussed in detail with Mr. XYZ.  Greater than 80 minutes were spent facet-to-face at this visit.  I have offered to re-image her cervical and lumbar spine and have included a thoracic MR imaging and rib series, as well as cervicolumbar flexion and extension views to evaluate for mobile segment and/or thoracic fractures.  I do not suspect any sort of intrathoracic comorbidity such as a neoplasm or mass, though this was discussed.  Pending the results of her preliminary studies, this should be ruled out.  I will see her in followup in about two weeks with the results of her scans.",Orthopedic

Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.

She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity and will be maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.

She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  Incisions were then made.  Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line.  Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation.  The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies.  There was a small plica.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia.  Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability.  ACL was noted to be intact.  The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology.  Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica.  The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles.  The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed.  The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%.  At the end of the case, all instruments were removed.  The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine.  Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case.  The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s.

The patient states that she was knocked over by her friend's dog.  She sustained a subcapital left hip fracture.  Prior to admission, she lived alone in Terrano, was ambulating with a walker.  All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were then discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained.,HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: , A 28 mm medium head was used, a small cemented femoral stem was used, and a 28 x 46 cup was used.,PROCEDURE:  ,All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  She was then transferred from the preoperative care unit to operating suite #1.  Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic without complications.,After this, the patient was transferred to the operating table and positioned.  All bony prominences were well padded.  She was positioned on a beanbag in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip facing upwards.  The left lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the normal fashion.  A skin maker was then used to mark all bony prominences.  Skin incision was then carried out extending from the greater trochanter in a curvilinear fashion posteriorly across the buttocks.  A #10 blade Bard-Parker scalpel was used to incise the skin through to the subcutaneous tissues.  A second #10 blade was then used to incise through the subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata.  This was then incised utilizing Metzenbaum scissors.  This was taken down to the bursa, which was removed utilizing a rongeur.  Utilizing a periosteal elevator as well as the sponge, the fat was then freed from the short external rotators of the left hip after these were placed and stretched.  The sciatic nerve was then visualized and retracted utilizing a Richardson retractor.  Bovie was used to remove the short external rotators from the greater trochanter, which revealed the joint capsule.  The capsule was cleared and incised utilizing a T-shape incision.  A fracture hematoma was noted upon entering the joint capsule as well as subcapital hip fracture.  A cork screw was then used to remove the fractured femoral head, which was given to the scrub tech which was sized on the back table.  All bony remnants were then removed from the acetabulum and surrounding soft tissue with a rongeur.  Acetabulum was then inspected and found to be clear.  Attention was then turned to the proximal femur where a cutting tunnel was used to mark the femur for the femoral neck cut.  An oscillating saw was then used to make the femoral cut.  Box osteotome was then used to remove the bone from proximal femur.  A Charnley awl was then used to open the femoral canal, paying close attention to keep the awl in the lateral position.  Next, attention was turned to broaching.  Initially, a small broach was placed, first making efforts to lateralize the broach then the femoral canal.  It was felt that the patient has less benefit from a cemented prosthesis and a small size was appropriate.  Next, the trial components were inserted consisting of the above-mentioned component sizes.  The hip was taken through range of motion and tested to adduction, internal and external rotations as well as with a shuck and a posterior directed force on a flexed tip.  It was noted that these size were stable through the range of motion.  Next, the trial components were removed and the femoral canal was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried utilizing Super sucker and __________ then inserted pressuring the femoral canal.  The femoral component was then inserted and then held under pressure.  Extruding cement was removed from the proximal femur.  After the cement had fully hardened and dried, the head and cup were applied.  The hip was subsequently reduced and taken again through range of motion, which was felt to be stable.,Next, the capsule was closed utilizing #1 Ethibond in figure-of-eight fashion.  Next, the fascia lata was repaired utilizing a figure-of-eight Ethibond sutures.  The most proximal region at the musculotendinous junction was repaired utilizing a running #1 Vicryl suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated again to suction dry.  Next, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated using #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures.  The skin was then reapproximated utilizing skin clips.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs as well as foam tape.

After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact.  The screws were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.

The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.

Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from.  At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads.  Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region.  Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain.  The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot.  There was no obvious joint involvement.  After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound.  The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue.  The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.",Orthopedic

Repair flexor carpi radialis.,2.  Repair palmaris longus.,ANESTHETIC: , General.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Less than 30 minutes.,CLINICAL NOTE:  ,The patient is a 21-year-old who sustained a clean laceration off a teapot last night.  She had lacerated her flexor carpi radialis completely and 90% of her palmaris longus.  Both were repaired proximal to the carpal tunnel.  The postoperative plans are for a dorsal splint and early range of motion passive and active assist.  The wrist will be at approximately 30 degrees of flexion.  The MPJ is at 30 degrees of flexion, the IP straight.  Splinting will be used until the 4-week postoperative point.,PROCEDURE: , Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  There were 2 transverse lacerations.  Through the first laceration, the flexor carpi radialis was completely severed.  The proximal end was found with a tendon retriever.  The distal end was just beneath the subcutaneous tissue.,A primary core stitch was used with a Kessler stitch.  This was with 4-0 FiberWire.  A second core stitch was placed, again using 4-0 FiberWire.  The repair was oversewn with locking, running, 6-0 Prolene stitch.  Through the second incision, the palmaris longus was seen to be approximately 90% severed.  It was an oblique laceration.  It was repaired with a 4-0 FiberWire core stitch and with a Kessler-type stitch.  A secure repair was obtained.  She was dorsiflexed to 75 degrees of wrist extension without rupture of the repair.  The fascia was released proximally and distally to give her more room for excursion of the repair.,The tourniquet was dropped, bleeders were cauterized.  Closure was routine with interrupted 5-0 nylon.  A bulky hand dressing as well as a dorsal splint with the wrist MPJ and IP as noted.  The splint was dorsal.

2228,Consultation for FCR tendinitis,"HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM:,  XYZ was seen by Dr. ABC for an FCR tendinitis.  We do not have his reports, but by history she has had two cortisone shots.  She plays musical instruments, and it does bother her from time to time.  She was considering surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and it seems to be well-controlled.  She is here now for consultation. ,CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,General:  The patient is alert and oriented times three in no acute distress. ,Skin:  No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis.,Vascular:  2+ radial and ulnar artery pulses.,Musculoskeletal:  Wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck exams reveal no focal findings except for some tenderness to palpation over the FCR tendon on the scaphoid tubercle, but there is no SL instability and no signs of lunotriquetral instability or midcarpal instability.  The DRUJ is stable.  Flexion/extension of the fingers is all intact.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no other focal tenderness to palpation.,Neurologic:  Negative Tinel's, Phalen's and compression median nerve test.  APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous have 5/5 strength.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no neurologic compromise.,Gait:  Normal.,Neck:  Negative Spurling sign.  Negative signs of thoracic outlet.,HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive with no asymmetry.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION:,  By history, possible FCR tendinitis.,EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:  At this point, we have asked her some questions again.  She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots.  Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots.  She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release.  It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem.  My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis.  She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery.",Orthopedic

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Orthopedic

We increased his extension and flexion to about 20 to 120 degrees and the pronation and supination to about 40 degrees.,LOCAL ANESTHETIC:  ,10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire was located.  An incision was made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision was made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound was then irrigated.  The triceps split was now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, as well as bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision, as well as the joint line.  At the beginning of the case, prior to removal of the hardware, the arm was taken through some strenuous manipulations with improvement of his extension to 20 degrees, flexion to 130 degrees and pronation supination to about 40 degrees.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The postoperative films demonstrated no fracture, no retained hardware.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will restart physical therapy and Dynasplint in 3 days.  The patient is to follow up in 1 week's time for a wound check.  The patient was given Tylenol No.  3 for pain.",Orthopedic
2243,Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.

Fascial lengthening flap of the 1st dorsal compartment.,ANESTHESIA:,  MAC.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After MAC anesthesia and appropriate antibiotics were administered, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision just distal to the radial styloid.  Dissection was carried down directly to the 1st dorsal compartment with the superficial radial nerve identified and protected.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.,I dissected the sheath superficially free of any other structures, specifically the superficial radial nerve.  I then incised it under direct vision dorsal to its axis and incised it both proximally and distally.  The EPB subsheath was likewise released.,I irrigated the wound thoroughly.  In order to prevent tendon subluxation, I then back-cut both the dorsal and volar leafs of the sheath so that I could close them in an extended and lengthened position.  I did this with 3-0 Vicryl.  I then passed an instrument underneath to check and make sure that the sheath was not too tight.  I then irrigated it and closed the skin, and then I dressed and splinted the wrist appropriately.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Orthopedic
2249,"Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment as well as medial malleolar fragment.","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment, as well as medial malleolar fragment.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,HISTORY: , This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky.,The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour.  He was on a curve and lost control.  He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding.  There were no other injuries.  He was treated in Kentucky.  A close reduction was performed and splint applied.  Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan.  The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.  As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue.  The patient is expected to do well overall.  He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan.  However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment.  Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",Orthopedic

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.

This loose body was then subsequently removed.  It measured 24 x 14 mm.  This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain.  He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee.  The patient presented here for a second opinion.  Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The standard portals were marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade.  Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line.  There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch.  This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal.  Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis.  The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology.  ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect.  The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver.  Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances.  Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites.  All instruments were then removed.  The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee.  Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias.  The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes.  He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family.  The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos.  There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle.  His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.  All questions were answered.  The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days.",Orthopedic

Stemmed tibial component, size 2.,5.  Palacos cement with antibiotics x2 batches.,INDICATION: , The patient is an 84-year-old female with significant endstage osteoarthritis of the left knee, who has had rapid progression with pain and disability.  Surgery was indicated to relieve her pain and improve her functional ability.  Goal objectives and the procedure were discussed with the patient.  Risks and benefits were explained.  No guarantees have been made or implied.  Informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and once an adequate spinal anesthesia with Duramorph was achieved, her left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed proximally in the thigh.  Antibiotics were infused prior to Foley catheter insertion.  Time-out procedure was called.,A straight longitudinal anterior midline incision was made.  Dissection was carried down sharply down the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the fascia.  Deep fascia was exposed.  The tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmHg prior to the skin incision.  A standard medial parapatellar approach was made.  The quadriceps tendon was incised approximately 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion.  Incision was then carried down distally and distal arthrotomy was completed.  Patellar tendon was well protected.  Retinaculum and capsule was incised approximately 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair.  The knee was exposed very well.  Significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted.  The osteophytes were removed with a rongeur.  Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were excised.  Medial and lateral meniscectomies were performed.  Medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the proximal tibia to address the varus deformity.  The medial compartment was more affected than lateral.  Medial ligaments were tied.  Retropatellar fat pad was excised.  Osteophytes were removed.  Using a Cobb elevator, the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected.,Attention was placed for the preparation of the femur.  The trochlear notch was ossified.  A rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an intramedullary drill guide, a starting hole was created slightly anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior portal was 1 cm anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior femoral sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of external rotation.  Rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and Whiteside line.  The pins were positioned in the appropriate holes.  Anterior femoral cut was performed after placing the cutting guide.  Now, the distal cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned.  A distal femoral cut was made which was satisfactory.  A sizer was positioned which was noted to be D.  The 5-in-1 cutting block size D was secured with spring pins over the resected bone.  Using an oscillating saw, cuts were made in a sequential manner such as anterior condyle, posterior condyle, anterior chamfer, and posterior chamfer.  Then using a reciprocating saw, intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made.  Following this, the cutting block for High-Flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle.  Using a reciprocating saw, the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed.  The bone with its attached soft tissue was removed.  Once the femoral preparation was completed, attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia.  The medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor.  The PCL retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly.  Osteophytes were removed.  The extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  Similarly, horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe.  Once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane, the tibial EM guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest.  A built-in 7-degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation.  Now, the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially, which was the most affected site.  Tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane.  The resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site.  The resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially.  Now, attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle.  Using curved osteotome, angle curette, and a rongeur, the posterior osteophytes were removed.  Now, attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion.  Rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension.  The 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension.,Attention was now placed for completion of the tibia.  Size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned.  Appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod.  Reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before.  The midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  The rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor.  At this point, trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner.  The range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory.  No further soft tissue release was indicated.  I was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee.,Attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella.  Using a patellar caliper, the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm.  This gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact.  Reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide.  Using a caliper, the resected patella was measured, which was noted to be 13 mm.  A 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well.  Drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty.  The tracking was satisfactory.  There was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella.  The trial components position was satisfactory.  The alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory.  All the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system.  The resected surfaces were dried with a sponge.  Two batches of Palacos cement were mixed.  The cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella.  Excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife.  The knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner.  Patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all-poly patella.  Once the cement was set hard and cured, tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive Prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner.  Range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees.  Anterior-posterior drawer test was satisfactory.  Medial and lateral stability was satisfactory.  Patellar tracking was satisfactory.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  A local cocktail was injected, which included the mixture of 0.25% plain Marcaine, 30 mg of Toradol, and 4 mg of morphine.  The quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with #1 Vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl and 0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl proximally.  The skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  She tolerated the procedure very well.",Orthopedic

All risks and benefits were explained.  Questions answered.  Options discussed.  No guarantees were made.  She wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease.  Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.",Orthopedic

The patient had tried nonoperative therapy, which did not assist the patient.  The patient had previous diagnosis of carpal tunnel and EMG showed compression of the right median nerve.  As a result of these findings, the patient was sent to my office presenting with this history and was carefully evaluated.  On initial evaluation, the patient had the symptomology of carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient at the time had the risks, benefits, and alternatives thoroughly explained to her.  All questions were answered.  No guarantees were given.  The patient had agreed to the surgical procedure and the postoperative rehabilitation as needed.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given sedation.  The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications.",Orthopedic

A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.  One cc of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free.  ,The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.  Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",Orthopedic

Left calcaneal lengthening osteotomy with allograft.,2.  Partial plantar fasciotomy.,3.  Posterior subtalar and tibiotalar capsulotomy.,4.  Short leg cast placed.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 69 minutes.,The patient in local anesthetic of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:  ,None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve.  There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way.  Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This was performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy.  It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles was repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.  A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control.  The patient to be strict nonweightbearing.  We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair.  The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control.  The patient will need an AFO script at that time.  Intraoperative findings are relayed to the parents.",Orthopedic

Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation and Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bunion, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Bunion, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation.,2.  Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.,HISTORY: , This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.  The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d.

Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin.  His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis.  Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure.,This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  He understood them well.  All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues.  This was made through the prior incision site.  There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site.  Medial and lateral flaps were then made.  The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed.  Effusion within the knee was noted.  All hematoma was evacuated.  I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene.  Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution.  Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue.  A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position.  The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee.  Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline.  The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples.  Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint.,No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",Orthopedic

He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.

He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.

He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff.,The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder.  At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon.  The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint.  An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch.  Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella.  There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter.  Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted.  While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal.  This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line.  A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed.  Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear.  The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia.  Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign.  PCL was also noted to be intact.  Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns.  It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle.  An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus.  It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee.  Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection.  The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured.  The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact.  Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella.  This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver.  It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly.,Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity.

The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications.",Orthopedic

The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon was noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch.  Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary.  The arthroscopic instruments were removed.  An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision was taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia was identified.  It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon was identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon was identified.  It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified.  The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.  The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.",Orthopedic

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.",Orthopedic

He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.,ALLERGIES:,  NKDA,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,  Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.  Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot.,RADIOGRAPHS:,  Of his right ankle today show a preserved joint space.  I don't see any evidence of fracture noted.  Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.,IMPRESSION:,  Right Achilles tendon rupture.,PLAN:,  I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ¼"" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1"" lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.

Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed.

The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure.,Upon examination and dissection of the conjunctiva superiorly, a scleral rupture was found. The rupture extended approximately 15 mm in length superior to the cornea, approximately 2 mm from the limbus in a horizontal fashion. There was also a rupture at the limbus, near the middle of this laceration, causing the anterior chamber to be flat. There was a large blood clot filling the anterior chamber. An attempt was made to wash out the anterior chamber with BSS on a cannula. The BSS was injected through the limbal rupture, which communicated with the anterior chamber. The blood clot did not move. It was extremely adherent to the iris.,At that time, the rupture that involved the limbus from approximately 10:30 until 12 o'clock was closed using 1 suture of 10-0 nylon. The scleral laceration was then closed using 10 interrupted sutures with 9-0 Vicryl. At that time, the anterior chamber was formed and appeared to be fairly deep. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The knots were rotated posteriorly and the conjunctiva was draped up over the sutures and sewn into position at the limbus using four 7-0 Vicryl sutures, 2 nasally and 2 temporally.

The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove all remaining cortex.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  An AMO model SI40NB posterior chamber intraocular lens with power *** diopters and serial number *** was injected into the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was placed with the Sinskey hook.  The lens was made well centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and eccentric posterior chamber intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Vigamox and Econopred drops were applied.  A soft eye patch followed by a firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours.  Complications none.",Ophthalmology

All of their questions were answered.  Informed consent was signed.  The patient was brought into the operating room.  A surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  After administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,The right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  A 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with Supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with Healon.  The clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  A 7-0 Vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  A microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  The presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  Two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,The vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  The pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the BIOM non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  The vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  A posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,The foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  The exit wound was explored.  No intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  The intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,An air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  No retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  The plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  Each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #XXX band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the Watzke sleeve.  The buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 Mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  The buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,Residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  A 12% concentration of C3F8 gas was flushed through the eye.  The infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 Vicryl suture.  All of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.  The intraocular pressure following injection of 0.05 mL each of vancomycin (0.5 mg) and ceftazidime (1 mg) were injected through the superotemporal pars plana, 30-gauge needles.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures with the knots buried.  Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and Decadron were delivered inferotemporally.  The lid speculum was removed.  Pred-G ointment and atropine solution were applied to the ocular surface.

Informed consent was obtained. On the day of surgery, (s)he received several sets of drops in the XXX eye including 2.5% phenylephrine, 1% Mydriacyl, 1% Cyclogyl, Ocuflox and Acular. (S)he was taken to the operating room and sedated via IV sedation. 2% lidocaine jelly was placed in the XXX eye (or, retrobulbar anesthesia was performed using a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% marcaine). The XXX eye was prepped using a 10% Betadine solution. (S)he was covered in sterile drapes leaving only the XXX eye exposed. A Lieberman lid speculum was placed to provide exposure. The Thornton fixation ring and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 (or 11 depending upon side and handedness, and assuming superior incision) o'clock. Then 1% lidocaine was injected through the paracentesis. After the nonpreserved lidocaine was injected, Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Thornton fixation ring and a 2.75 mm keratome blade were used to create a two-step full-thickness clear corneal incision superiorly. The cystitome and Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous capsulorrhexis in the anterior lens capsule. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. Phacoemulsification was then performed to remove the nucleus. I & A was performed to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected to fill the capsular bag and anterior chamber. A XXX diopter SN60AT (for Acrysof natural lens) intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag. The Kuglen hook was used to rotate it into proper position in the capsular bag. I & A was performed to remove the remaining Viscoelastic material from the eye. BSS on the 30-gauge cannula was used to hydrate the wound. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight.

2415,Patient being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your kind referral for patient ABC.  Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,,",Ophthalmology
2416,Patient referred for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear XYZ:,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Mrs. ABC who you referred to me for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.  I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.  If I can provide any additional information or be of further service, do let me know.,Sincerely,,",Ophthalmology

Extraocular muscles were intact, visual fields were full to confrontation OU, and applanations are 12 mmHg bilaterally.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect.  On slit lamp examination, lids and lashes were within normal limits.  The conj is quiet.  The cornea shows 1+ guttata bilaterally.  The AC is deep and quiet and irises are within normal limits bilaterally.  There is a dense 3 to 4+ nuclear sclerotic cataract in each eye.  On dilated fundus examination, cup-to-disc ratio is 0.1 OU.  The vitreous, macula, vessels, and periphery all appear within normal limits.,Impression:  It appears that Ms. ABC' visual decline is caused by bilateral cataracts.  She would benefit from having removed.  The patient also showed some mild guttata OU indicating possible early Fuchs dystrophy.  The patient should do well with cataract surgery and I have recommended this and she agreed to proceed with the first eye here shortly.  I will keep you up to date of her progress and any new findings as we perform her surgery in each eye.,Again, thank you for your kind referral of this kind lady and I will be in touch with you.,Sincerely,,",Ophthalmology

The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.

The patient then had the wound freshened up with Westcott scissors and cotton-tip applications. Hemostasis was achieved with a high-temp disposable cautery. Once this had been done, the proximal end of the XXX upper lid canalicular system was intubated with a Monoka tube on a Prolene. The proximal end was then found and this was intubated with the same tubing system. Then, two 6-0 Vicryl sutures were used to reapproximate the medial canthal tendon. Once this had been done, the skin was reapproximated with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures. To ensure that the punctum was in the correct position and in the Monoka tube was seated with a seater, and the tube was cut short.

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.  Lid speculum was removed.  TobraDex ointment, light patch and a Soft Shield were applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room, awake and comfortable.

2433,Normal cataract surgery.,"NORMAL CATARACT SURGERY,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room where the Rand-Stein anesthesia protocol was followed using alfentanil and Brevital.  Topical tetracaine drops were applied.  The operative eye was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was inserted.,Under the Zeiss operating microscope, a lateral clear corneal approach was utilized.  A stab incision was made with a diamond blade to the right of the lateral limbus and the anterior chamber filled with intracameral lidocaine and viscoelastic.  A 3-mm single pass clear corneal incision was made just anterior to the vascular arcade of the temporal limbus using a diamond keratome.  A 5- to 5.5-mm anterior capsulorrhexis was created.  The nucleus was hydrodissected and hydrodelineated, and was freely movable in the capsular bag.  The nucleus was then phacoemulsified using a quadrantic divide-and-conquer technique.  Following the deep groove formation, the lens was split bimanually and the resultant quadrants and epicortex removed under high-vacuum burst-mode phacoemulsification.  Peripheral cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration handpiece.  The posterior capsule was polished.  The capsular bag was expanded with viscoelastic.  The implant was inspected under the microscope and found to be free of defects.  The implant was inserted into the cartridge system under viscoelastic and placed in the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was positioned with the cartridge system.  Residual viscoelastic was removed from the anterior chamber and from behind the implant.  The corneal wound was hydrated with balanced salt solution.  The anterior chamber was fully re-formed through the side-port incision.  The wound was inspected and found to be watertight.

2437,A sample note on Cataract,"CATARACT, is the loss of transparency of the lens of the eye.  It often appears like a window that is fogged with steam.,WHAT CAUSES CATARACT FORMATION?,*  Aging, the most common cause.,*  Family history.,*  Steroid use.,*  Injury to the eye.,*  Diabetes.,*  Previous eye surgery.,*  Long-term exposure to sunlight.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A CATARACT?,*  The best way for early detection is regular eye examinations by your medical eye doctor. There are many causes of visual loss in addition to the cataract such as problems involving the optic nerve and retina.  If these other problems exist, cataract removal may not result in the return or improvement of vision.  Your eye doctor can tell you how much improvement in vision is likely.,DOES IT TAKE A LONG TIME FOR A CATARACT TO FORM?,Cataract development varies greatly between patients and is affected by the cause of the cataract.  Generally, cataracts progress gradually over many years.  Some people, especially diabetics and younger patients, may find that cataract formation progresses rapidly over a few months making it impossible to know exactly how long it will take for the cataract to develop. ,WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS?,The only way to remove a cataract is surgery.  If the symptoms are not restricting your activity, a change of glasses may alleviate the symptoms at this time.  No medications, exercise, optical devices or dietary supplements have been shown to stop the progression or prevent cataracts.,It is important to provide protection from excessive sunlight.  Making sure that the sunglasses you wear screen out ultraviolet (UV) light rays or your regular eyeglasses are coated with a clear, anti-UV coating will help prevent or slow the progression of cataracts.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED SURGERY?,Surgery is considered when your vision is interfering with your daily activities.  It is important to evaluate if you can see to do your job and drive safely.  Can you read and watch TV in comfort? Are you able to cook, do your shopping and yard work or take your medications without difficulty? Depending on how you feel your vision is affecting your daily life, you and your eye doctor will decide together when it is the appropriate time to do surgery.,WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH CATARACT SURGERY?,This surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.  With the assistance of a microscope, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens implant.,Right after the surgery you should be able to immediately perform all your normal activities except for the most strenuous ones.  You will need to take eye drops as directed by your eye doctor.  Follow-up visits are necessary to make sure the surgical site is healing without problems.,This procedure is performed on over 1.4 million people each year in the United States alone, 95% without complications.  With this highly successful procedure, 90% of the time vision improves unless a problem also exists with the cornea, retina or optic nerve.  As with any surgery, a good result cannot be guaranteed.",Ophthalmology

The lens was inspected and found to be free of defects, folded, and easily inserted into the capsular bag, and unfolded.","PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Cataract extraction with lens implantation, right eye.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room.  The patient was identified and the correct operative site was also identified.  A retrobulbar block using 5 ml of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine was done after adequate anesthetic was assured, and the eye was massaged to reduce risk of bleeding.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A lid speculum was applied.,A groove incision at the 12 o'clock position was made with a 5700 blade.  This was beveled anteriorly in a lamellar fashion using the crescent knife.  Then the anterior chamber was entered with a slit knife.  The chamber was deepened with Viscoat.  Then a paracentesis at the 3 o'clock position was created using a super sharp blade.  A cystitome was used to nick the anterior capsule and then the capsulotomy was completed with capsulorrhexis forceps.  Hydrodissection was employed using BSS on a blunt 27-gauge needle.,The phaco tip was then introduced into the eye, and the eye was divided into 4 grooves.  Then a second instrument was used, a Sinskey hook, to crack these grooves, and the individual quadrants were brought into the central zone and phacoemulsified.  I/A proceeded without difficulty using the irrigation/aspiration cannula.  The capsule was felt to be clear and intact.  The capsular bag was then expanded with ProVisc.,The internal corneal wound was increased using the slit knife.  The lens was inspected and found to be free of defects, folded, and easily inserted into the capsular bag, and unfolded.

Visual field testing showed *% superior hemifield loss on the right, and *% superior hemifield loss on the left.  These field losses resolved with upper eyelid taping which simulates the expected surgical correction.  Photodocumentation also showed the upper eyelids resting on the upper eyelashes, as well as a decrease in the effective superior marginal reflex distance.  The risks, benefits, limitations, alternatives, and expected improvement in symptoms and visual field loss were discussed in preoperative evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, On the day of surgery, the surgical site and procedure were verified by the physician with the patient.  An informed consent was signed and witnessed.  EMLA cream was applied to the eyelids and eyebrow region for 10 minutes to provide skin anesthesia.  Two drops of topical proparacaine eye drops were placed on the ocular surface.  The skin was cleaned with alcohol prep pads.  The patient received 3 to 4 mL of 2% Lidocaine with epinephrine and 0.5% Marcaine mixture to each upper lid.  5 to 6 mL of local were also given to the brow region along the entire length.  Pressure was applied over each site for 5 minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for oculoplastic surgery.,The desired amount of redundant brow tissue to be excised was carefully marked with a surgical marking pen on each side.  The contour of the outline was created to provide a greater temporal lift.  Care was taken to preserve a natural contour to the brow shape consistent with the patient’s desired features.  Using a #15 blade, the initial incision was placed just inside the superior most row of brow hairs, in parallel with the follicle growth orientation.  The incision extended in a nasal to temporal fashion with the nasal portion incision being carried down to muscle and becoming progressively shallower toward the tail of the incision line.  The dimensions of the redundant tissue measured * horizontally and * vertically.  The redundant tissue was removed sharply with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was maintained with hand held cautery and/or electrocautery.  The closure was carried out in multiple layers.  The deepest muscular/subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 transparent nylon in a horizontal mattress fashion.  The intermediate layer was closed with 5-0 Vicryl similarly.  The skin was closed with 6-0 nylon in a running lock fashion.  Iced saline gauze pads were placed over the incision sites.  This completed the brow repair portion of the case.,Using a surgical marking pen, a vertical line was drawn from the superior punctum to the eyebrow.  An angled line was drawn from the ala of the nares to the lateral canthus edge and extending to the tail of the brow.  These lines served as the relative boundary for the horizontal length of the blepharoplasty incision.  The desired amount of redundant tissue to be excised was carefully pinched together with 0.5 forceps.  This tissue was outlined with a surgical marking pen.  Care was taken to avoid excessive skin removal near the brow region.  A surgical ruler was used to ensure symmetry.  The skin and superficial orbicularis were incised with a #15 blade on the first upper lid.  This layer was removed with Westcott scissors.,Hemostasis was achieved with high-temp hand held pen cautery.  The remaining orbicularis and septum were grasped superiorly and inferiorly on each side of the incision and tented upward.  The high temp cautery pen was then used to incise these layers in a horizontal fashion until preapeuronotic fat was identified.  * amount of central preaponeurotic fat was removed with cautery.  * amount of nasal fat pad was removed in the same fashion.  Care was taken to not disturb the levator aponeurosis.  A symmetric amount of fat was removed from each side.  Iced gauze saline was placed over the site and the entire procedure repeated on the fellow eyelid.  Skin hooks were placed on either side of the incision and the skin was closed in a continuous running fashion with 6-0 nylon.  Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was placed over the incision site and on the ocular surface.  Saline gauze and cold packs were placed over the upper lids.  The patient was taken from the surgical suite in good condition.,DISCHARGE:,  In the recovery area the results of surgery were discussed with the patient and their family.  Specific instructions to resume all p.o. oral medications including anticoagulants/antiplatelets were given.  Written instructions and restrictions after eyelid surgery were reviewed with the patient and family member.  Instructions on antibiotic ointment use were reviewed.  The incision sites were checked prior to release.  The patient was released to home with a driver after vital signs were deemed stable.",Ophthalmology

Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.

She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.

He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.,FINDINGS: , There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.

The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.

3506,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"PROCEDURE:,:  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient is currently being aroused from general endotracheal anesthesia.  I was present during the entire case.",Gastroenterology

Cholelithiasis.,2.  Chronic cholecystitis.,NAME OF OPERATION: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,FINDINGS:,  The gallbladder was thickened and showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis.  There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was slightly larger.  There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder.  The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small.  With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct.  Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.,PROCEDURE:,  Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully.  Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.,After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.  The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted.  Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed.  One or two bleeding areas were fulgurated, and bleeding was well controlled.",Gastroenterology

The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.  Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",Gastroenterology

3525,GI Consultation for Chrohn's disease.,"PROBLEM:  ,Prescription evaluation for Crohn's disease., ,HISTORY: , This is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of Imuran.  He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.

Cystoscopy with left ureteral stent.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old gentleman who had a previous perforated diverticula.  Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.,The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization.  The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure.  _____ were performed.

Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.",Gastroenterology

Risks, benefits, and alternatives including, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, perforation, adverse reaction to medication, failure to identify pathology, pancreatitis, and death explained to the patient and his wife, who accepted all risks.  The patient was prepped in the left lateral position.  IV sedation was given to a total of fentanyl 100 mcg and midazolam 4 mg for the initial EGD.  An additional 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam were given following erythromycin.  Scope tip of the Olympus gastroscope was passed into the esophagus.  Proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the esophagus were well visualized.  There was fresh blood in the esophagus, which was washed thoroughly, but no source was seen.  No evidence of varices was seen.  The stomach was entered.  The stomach was filled with very large clot and fresh blood and liquid, which could not be suctioned due to the clot burden.  There was a small amount of bright red blood near the fundus, but a source could not be identified due to the clot burden.  Because of this, the gastroscope was withdrawn.  The patient was given 250 mg of erythromycin in the Emergency Department and 30 minutes later, the scope was repassed.  On the second look, the esophagus was cleared.  The liquid gastric contents were cleared.  There was still a moderate amount of clot burden in the stomach, but no active bleeding was seen.  There was a small grade I esophageal varices, but no stigmata of bleed.  There was also a small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia, but no source of bleeding was identified.

The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2.

3610,Patient comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy.,"HISTORY:,  A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband.  She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy.  Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal.  Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy.  I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so.  She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain.  She has had no hematochezia.  She denies any melena.  She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history.  Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.  She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.,MEDICATIONS: , Reglan 10 mg once a day.,ALLERGIES: , She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.

She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.,NEURO:  No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.,ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy.  We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers.  She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well.  I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.,We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.",Gastroenterology

3620,Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago.  She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes.  She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:  , The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided.  In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She was noted to have some pools of stool.  This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:,  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.  She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.  Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated.",Gastroenterology

Prostate was normal in size and consistency.,The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum.  The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve.  Navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed.,The cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen.  There was not even a scar representing the prior polyp.  I was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and I saw no lesion at all.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn.  In the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma.  It was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa.  There was a similar lesion in the descending colon.  Both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them.  There were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon.  In addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery.  There was no bleeding.  The scope was then withdrawn.  The rectum was normal.  When the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare.

Cholelithiasis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS: , This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea.  Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall.  The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain.  Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised.  Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia.  Fascia was opened vertically.  Stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.,Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left.  A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes.  Liver was grossly normal.  Gallbladder was noted to be thickened.  Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.,The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated.  It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal.  There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted.  It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly.  The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips.  Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.,The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port.  Specimen was sent for histopathology.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2.  Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect.  Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat.  In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory.  Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.",Gastroenterology

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.,Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.,The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.",Gastroenterology

Antibiotics had been given prior to incision.  A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately there was  purulent material seen in the area.  Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets.  The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall.  There was quite a bit of local peritonitis.  The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch.  The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis.

Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.

The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.,FINDINGS: , Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.

3712,A sample note on serous otitis media,"Because children need hearing to learn speech, hearing loss from fluid in the middle ear can result in speech delay.  Children begin to speak some words by 18 months.  Children with fluid in both ears can show significant delay in their use of language.  In addition, young children learn to pronounce words by hearing them spoken.  When there is a hearing loss, even a mild one, the spoken words of parents and siblings are distorted to the child with fluid in the ears.  Identification of fluid in the middle ear is important, not only to prevent future speech problems, but to avoid permanent damage to the eardrum and the middle ear.  Most children will have at least one ear infection before the age of four.,With treatment, the ear infections clear up promptly.  Without the follow-up visit, fluid may still be present, even though the child has no complaints or symptoms.  Therefore, it is essential that ear infections be rechecked after initial treatment.  Usually, the presence of fluid results in a ""mild conductive hearing loss."" This could be as much as 30% hearing loss overall.  After the specialist confirms that fluid is present behind both eardrums, further medical treatment is often advised.  This may consist of additional antibiotics, decongestants, and in some cases, nasal sprays.  If fluid has been present for over 12 weeks, surgical drainage of the fluid is often indicated.  The decision to perform surgery should be based on the response to medical treatment, the degree of hearing loss and the appearance of the eardum itself under the surgical microscope.  Surgery which drains fluid involves a small incision in the eardrum, so that the fluid can be gently removed and a tube can be inserted.  The procedure, medically termed a myringotomy and tubes, or tympanostomy and tube, (BMT if Bilateral) or PET (Pressure Equalizing Tubes), is performed on children under general anesthesia.",ENT - Otolaryngology

Dr. F's assessment at that time was the patient not had sleep apnea and did not truly even seem to have allergic rhinitis.  All of his symptoms had resolved when he had seen Dr. F, so no surgical plan was made and no further followup was needed.  However, the patient reports again today with his mother that they are now having continued symptoms of nasal obstruction and questionable sleep changes.  Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature.  It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime.  He also is sniffing a lot through his nose.  He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not.  The child is not having any problems with his ears including ear infections or hearing.  He is also not having any problems with strep throat.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Eczema.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  None.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , No family history of bleeding diathesis or anesthesia difficulties.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 43 pounds, height 37 inches, temperature 97.4, pulse 65, and blood pressure 104/48.,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished male in no acute distress.

There is no middle ear effusion.,ORAL CAVITY:  The patient has 2+ tonsils bilaterally.  There are clearly nonobstructive.  His uvula is midline.,NECK:  No lymphadenopathy appreciated.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a 5-year-old male, who presents for repeat evaluation of a possible nasal obstruction, questionable sleep apnea.  Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events.  They deny any actual gasping events.  It sounds like true obstructive events.  He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis.  I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately.  I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day.  I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis.  They may not see any benefit for several weeks.  I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing.  If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child.  He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems.  However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child.  Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all.  We will see him back in six weeks.",ENT - Otolaryngology

There are several causes including a viral or bacterial infection that spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes, nasal allergy drainage blocking the sinuses or eustachian tubes, enlarged adenoids also blocking sinuses or eustachian tubes and eardrum rupture.  Many factors can increase the risk of an ear infection like recent upper respiratory tract illness, crowded living conditions, family history of ear infections, day care, smoking in household, altitude changes, cold weather and genetic factors.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Irritability.,*  Ear pain, fullness, hearing loss.,*  Infants may pull on ear.,*  Fever.,*  Vomiting.,*  Discharge from ear.,*  Diarrhea.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is by physical exam and otoscopic exam.  Sometimes fluid from the ear is cultured.,*  Pain relievers, like acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Infant pain relievers are available.,*  Decongestant to relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.,*  Antibiotics when indicated for bacterial infection such as Amoxicillin or Zithromycin.  Finish ALL antibiotics as prescribed.  Do not stop the medication even if symptoms subside.,*  Avoid swimming until infection goes away.,*  Surgery is sometimes necessary to put in tubes through the eardrum to equalize pressure and drain fluids.,*  Surgery to remove adenoids if they are enlarged.,*  Reduce activity until symptoms subside.,Call doctor's office if symptoms do not improve within 2 days of treatment, and for convulsion, fever, ear swelling, dizziness, twitching facial muscles and severe headache.",ENT - Otolaryngology

It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate.  She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.,At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis.  There was no incus.  There was no specific round window niche.  There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane.  The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position.  The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution.  The right ear was draped in the sterile field.  External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine.  A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position.  Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered.  This exposure included the oval window, round window areas.  There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum.  The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate.  The prosthesis was removed without difficulty.  The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied.  Malleus handle was mobile.  The footplate was fixed.  Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane.  The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation.  She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances.  No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area.  A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate.  The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear.  The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex.  The incision was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and individual #5-0 nylon to the skin, and a sterile dressing was applied.",ENT - Otolaryngology

He has a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face was prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa was decongested using Afrin pledgets as well as 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum was displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There was a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There was a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision was made.  Mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.  Vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum was corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incisions were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum was also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splints were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone was depressed and left nasal bone was wide.  Therefore, the nasal bones were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision was made and the nasal bones were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint was applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavities were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both sides with bacitracin ointment.  Approximate blood loss was 10 to 20 mL.",ENT - Otolaryngology

After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision.  A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator.  The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps.  The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest.  The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.  The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better.  The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps.  Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site.  The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection.  Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also.  The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy.  The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver.  The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it.

Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.

A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.",ENT - Otolaryngology
3766,Chronic headaches and pulsatile tinnitus.,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 48-year-old female who was seen in consultation requested from Dr. X on 05/28/2008 regarding chronic headaches and pulsatile tinnitus.  The patient reports she has been having daily headaches since 02/25/2008.  She has been getting pulsations in the head with heartbeat sounds.  Headaches are now averaging about three times per week.  They are generally on the very top of the head according to the patient.  Interestingly, she denies any previous significant history of headaches prior to this.  There has been no nausea associated with the headaches.  The patient does note that when she speaks on the phone, the left ear has ""weird sounds.""  She feels a general fullness in the left ear.  She does note pulsation sounds within that left ear only.  This began on February 17th according to the patient.  The patient reports that the ear pulsations began following an air flight to Iowa where she was visiting family.  The patient does admit that the pulsations in the ears seem to be somewhat better over the past few weeks.  Interestingly, there has been no significant drop or change in her hearing.  She does report she has had dizzy episodes in the past with nausea, being off balance at times.  It is not associated with the pulsations in the ear.  She does admit the pulsations will tend to come and go and there had been periods where the pulsations have completely cleared in the ear.  She is denying any vision changes.  The headaches are listed as moderate to severe in intensity on average about three to four times per week.  She has been taking Tylenol and Excedrin to try to control the headaches and that seems to be helping somewhat.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , ,ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  Negative.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypercholesterolemia.,PULMONARY:  Negative.,GASTROINTESTINAL:  Pertinent for nausea.,GENITOURINARY:  The patient is noted to be a living kidney donor and has only one kidney.,NEUROLOGIC:  History of dizziness and the headaches as listed above.,VISUAL:  Negative.,DERMATOLOGIC:  History of itching.

Sinuses palpated and are normal.  Salivary glands also palpated and are normal with no masses noted.  The patient also has full facial function.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,RESPIRATORY:  Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.,EYES:  Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.,EARS:  There is an old mastoidectomy scar, left ear.  The ear canals are clean and dry.  Drums intact and mobile.  Weber exam is midline.  Grossly hearing is intact.  Please note audiologist not available at today's visit for further audiologic evaluation.,NASAL:  Reveals clear drainage.  Deviated nasal septum to the left, listed as mild to moderate.  Ostiomeatal complexes are patent and turbinates are healthy.  There was no mass or neoplasm within the nasopharynx noted on fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy.  See fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy separate exam.,ORAL:  Oral cavity is normal with good moisture.  Lips, teeth and gums are normal.  Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx.  Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords.  The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.,NECK:  The neck was examined with normal appearance.  Trachea in the midline.  The thyroid was normal, nontender, with no palpable masses or adenopathy noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII evaluated and noted to be normal.

Pulsatile tinnitus, left ear with eustachian tube disorder as the etiology.  Consider, also normal pressure hydrocephalus.,2.  Recurrent headaches.,3.  Deviated nasal septum.,4.  Dizziness, again also consider possible Meniere disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I did recommend the patient begin a 2 g or less sodium diet.  I have also ordered a carotid ultrasound study as part of the workup and evaluation.  She has had a recent CAT scan of the brain though this was without contrast.  It did reveal previous mastoidectomy, left temporal bone, but no other mass noted.  I have started her on Nasacort AQ nasal spray one spray each nostril daily as this is eustachian tube related.  Hearing protection devices should be used at all times as well.  I did counsel the patient if she has any upcoming airplane trips to use nasal decongestant or topical nasal decongestant spray prior to boarding the plane, and also using the airplane ear plugs as these can be effective at helping to prevent eustachian tube issues.  I am going to recheck her in three weeks.  If the pulsatile tinnitus at that time is not clear, we have discussed other treatment options including myringotomy or ear tube placement, which could be done here in the office.  She will be scheduled for a audio and tympanogram to be done as well prior to that procedure.",ENT - Otolaryngology

The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis.  Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery.  The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia.  The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.,The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  After the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.,The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction.  The scope was then further removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , The patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris.  At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma.  If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia.  The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems.",ENT - Otolaryngology

3780,A sample note on bilateral myringotomy tubes,"Parents often ask why the fluid cannot be drained without inserting a tube.  The need for the tube insertion is because the eardrum incision generally heals very rapidly (within a few days), which is not long enough for the swollen membranes in the middle ear to return to normal.  As soon as the eardrum heals, fluid will reaccumulate.  Tubes were first introduced because of this very problem.  There are many types of tubes, but all tubes serve the same function.  They keep the eardrum open, allow air to enter the middle ear space, and permit fluid in the middle ear to drain.  Most tubes will gradually be rejected by the ear and work their way out of the eardrum.  As they come out, the eardrum seals behind the tube.  Tubes will last four to six months in the eardrum before they come out.  Occasionally, the eardrum does not heal completely when the tube comes out.,The majority of children treated with tubes do not require further surgery.  They may have ear infections in the future, but most will clear up with medical treatment.  Some children are very prone to ear infections and have a tendency to accumulate fluid after each infection.  Children tend to outgrow this cycle by age 7 or 8.  In an ear, nose and throat specialty practice, this group comprises 10 to 15% of all children who have required tubes.  Occasionally the physician has to physically remove the tube from the ear drum.",ENT - Otolaryngology

4031,A simple note on Acne Vulgaris.,"ACNE VULGARIS,, commonly referred to as just acne, is a chronic inflammation of the skin that occurs most often during adolescence but can occur off and on throughout life.  The skin eruptions most often appear on the face, chest, back and upper arms and are more common in males than females.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Blackheads the size of a pinhead.,*  Whiteheads similar to blackheads.,*  Pustules - lesions filled with pus.,*  Redness and inflamed skin.,*  Cysts - large, firm swollen lesions in severe acne.,*  Abscess - infected lesion that is swollen, tender, inflamed, filled with pus, also seen in severe acne.,CAUSES:,Oil glands in the skin become plugged for reasons unknown but during adolescence, sex-hormone changes play some role.  When oil backs up in the plugged gland, a bacteria normally present on skin causes an infection.  Acne is NOT caused by foods, uncleanliness or masturbation.  Cleaning the skin can decrease its severity but sexual activity has no effect on it.  A family history of acne can indicate if an individual will get acne and how severe it might be.  Currently, acne can't be prevented.,ACNE CAN BE BROUGHT ON OR MADE WORSE BY:,*  Hot or cold temperatures.,*  Emotional stress.,*  Oily skin.,*  Endocrine (hormone) disorder.,*  Drugs such as cortisones, male hormones, or oral contraceptives.,*  Some cosmetics.,*  Food sensitivities.  Again, foods do not cause acne but some certain ones may make it worse.  To discover any food sensitivities, eliminate suspicious foods from your diet and then start eating them again one at a time.  If acne worsens 2-3 days after consumption, then avoid this food.  Acne usually improves in summer so some foods may be tolerated in summer that can't be eaten in winter.,TREATMENT:,*  Most cases of acne respond well to treatment and will likely disappear once adolescence is over.  Even with adequate treatment, acne will tend to flare up from time to time and sometimes permanent facial scars or pitting of the skin may occur.,*  If your skin is oily, gently clean face with a fresh, clean wash cloth using unscented soap for 3- 5 minutes; an antibacterial soap may work better.  A previously used wet washcloth will harbor bacteria.  Don't aggressively scrub tender lesions as this may spread infection; be gentle.  Rinse the soap off for a good 1-2 minutes.  Dry face carefully with a clean towel and use an astringent such as rubbing alcohol that will remove the skin oil.,OTHER TIPS THAT MAY HELP ACNE:,*  Shampoo hair at least twice a week.  Keep hair off of face even while sleeping as hair can spread oil and bacteria.  If you have dandruff, use a dandruff shampoo.  Avoid cream hair rinses.,*  Wash sweat and skin oil off as soon as possible after sweating and exercising.,*  Use thinner, water-based cosmetics instead of the heavier oil-based ones.,*  Avoid skin moisturizers unless recommended by your doctor.,*  Do not squeeze, pick, rub or scratch your skin or the acne lesions.  This may damage the skin causing scarring and delay healing of acne.  Only a doctor should remove blackheads.,*  Keep from resting face on hands while reading, studying or watching TV.,*  Try to avoid pressing the phone receiver on you chin while talking on the phone.,*  Ultraviolet light may be a treatment recommended by your doctor but this is by no means a license to sunbathe!  Don't use the sun to treat acne.,*  Dermabrasion may be another option to treat acne scars.  This is a type of cosmetic surgery to help remove unsightly scars.,MEDICATIONS THAT MAY BE PRESCRIBED TO HELP ACNE INCLUDE:,*  Oral or topical antibiotics.,*  Cortisone injections into acne lesions.,*  Oral contraceptives.,*  Tretinoin, which may increase sun sensitivity and excessive dryness,  is not recommended during pregnancy.,*  Accutane (isotretinoin) is a powerful drug to treat acne but causes birth defects.  A woman taking this drug,must be on two types of birth control and have negative pregnancy tests.  This drug also increases sun,sensitivity.  Other more serious side effects can occur and your doctor will discuss those with you if Accutane is to be prescribed.,TETRACYCLINE:,Tetracycline is a very safe antibiotic.  It is not related to penicillin and an allergy to it is unusual.  There are several potential side effects:,1.  Tetracycline can cause nausea or heartburn.,2.  Tetracycline can cause vaginitis.,3.  Tetracycline can cause excessive sun burn.,CAUTIONS ON TETRACYCLINE:,1.  Do not take Tetracycline with milk or milk products (ice cream, cheese, yogurt, etc.).  This will cancel out the Tetracycline.  Separate the Tetracycline from these products by one and one-half hours before and after each capsule.  Do have a small amount of non milk-containing food in your stomach first to prevent nausea.,2.  Do not take Tetracycline if you are pregnant.",Dermatology

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.

Insertion of right internal jugular Tessio catheter.,2.  Placement of left wrist primary submental arteriovenous fistula.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The right neck, chest and left arm were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A small incision was made at the top of the anterior jugular triangle in the right neck.  Through this small incision, the right internal jugular vein was punctured and a guidewire was placed.  It was punctured a 2nd time, and a 2nd guidewire was placed.  The Tessio catheters were assembled.  They were measured for length.  Counter-incisions were made on the right chest.  They were then tunneled through these lateral chest wall incisions to the neck incision, burying the Dacron cuffs.  They were flushed with saline.  A suture was placed through the guidewire, and the guidewire and dilator were removed.  The arterial catheter was then placed through this, and the tear-away introducer was removed.  The catheter aspirated and bled easily.  It was flushed with saline and capped.  This was repeated with the venous line.  It also aspirated easily and was flushed with saline and capped.  The neck incision was closed with a 4-0 Tycron, and the catheters were sutured at the exit sites with 4-0 nylon.  Dressings were applied.  An incision was then made at the left wrist.  The basilic vein was dissected free, as was the radial artery.  Heparin was given, 50 mg.  The radial artery was clamped proximally and distally with a bulldog.  It was opened with a #11 blade and Potts scissors, and stay sutures of 5-0 Prolene were placed.  The vein was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  It was sutured to the radial artery with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The clamps were removed.  Good flow was noted through the artery.

His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

Varicose veins.,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Varicose veins.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Varicose veins.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee.,2.  Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Multiple veins.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  This is a 30-year-old Caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from Dr. X's office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity.  The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
4675,"Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

4680,"Pulmonary valve stenosis, supple pulmonic narrowing, and static encephalopathy","HISTORY: , The patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm Gore-Tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

4706,Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus.,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 5-1/2-year-old, who recently presented with a cardiac murmur diagnosed due to a patent ductus arteriosus.  An echocardiogram from 09/13/2007 demonstrated a 3.8-mm patent ductus arteriosus with restrictive left-to-right shunt.  There is mild left atrial chamber enlargement with an LA/AO ratio of 1.821.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with possible left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for device closure of a ductus arteriosus.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures up to the branch pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated a small, type A patent ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  Minimal diameter was approximately 1.6 mm with ampulla diameter of 5.8 mm and length of 6.2 mm.  The wedge catheter could be directed from the main pulmonary artery across the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta.  This catheter exchanged over wire for a 5-French nit-occlude delivery catheter through which a nit-occlude 6/5 flex coil that was advanced and allowed to reconfigure the descending aorta.  Entire system was then brought into the ductal ampulla or one loop of coil was delivered in the main pulmonary artery.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed by fluoroscopy, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic measurements and angiogram in the descending aorta were then repeated approximately 10 minutes following device implantation.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with a slight increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus.  The left-sided heart was fully saturated.  The phasic right-sided and left-sided pressures were normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal and pulmonary flow was slightly increased with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a small conical shaped ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  The branch pulmonary arteries appeared normal.  There is otherwise a normal left aortic arch.,Following coil embolization of the ductus arteriosus, there is no change in mixed venous saturation.  No evidence of residual left-to-right shunt.  There is no change in right-sided pressures.  There is a slight increase in the left-sided phasic pressures.  Calculated systemic flow was unchanged from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta showed a majority of coil mass to be within the ductal ampulla with minimal protrusion in the descending aorta as well as the coil in the main pulmonary artery.  There is a trace residual shunt through the center of coil mass.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:, Patent ductus arteriosus.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus.,MANAGEMENT:  ,The case to be discussed at Combined Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.

4710,PICC line insertion,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  PICC line insertion.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was identified by myself on presentation to the angiography suite.  His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure nicely and was discharged from Angiography in satisfactory condition back to the general floor.  We may make another attempt in the near future using a different approach.,",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.,5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.

The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein.

4725,Multiple stent placements with Impella circulatory assist device.,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.

She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.,2.  Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

4753,Patient is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy.,"CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

He has made multiple visits in the past. Today, the patient presents himself in severe respiratory distress. His wife states that since his recent admission of three weeks ago for treatment of pneumonia, he has not seemed to be able to recuperate, and has persistent complaints of shortness of breath.,Today, his symptoms worsened and she brought him to the emergency room. To the best of her knowledge, there has been no fever. He has persistent chronic cough, as always. More complete history cannot be taken because of the patient’s acute respiratory decompensation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Hypertension and emphysema.,MEDICATIONS:,  Lotensin and some water pill as well as, presumably, an Atrovent inhaler.,ALLERGIES:,  None are known.,HABITS:,  The patient is unable to cooperate with the history.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient lives in the local area with his wife.,REVIEW OF BODY SYSTEMS:,  Unable, secondary to the patient’s condition.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96 degrees, axillary.

No white cells and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure.

The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

Symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  She has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  Symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  The last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  On neither occasion did she lose consciousness.,Yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  While working on a computer, she had a spell.  Palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital's admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  She was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since.,No history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  She does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is a mother of two.  There is no family history of congenital heart disease.  She has had no history of thoracic trauma.  No symptoms to suggest thyroid disease.,No known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  Family history is negative for ischemic heart disease.,Remote history is significant for an ACL repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast.,No regular medications prior to admission.,The only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vital signs as charted.  Pupils are reactive.  Sclerae nonicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck veins not distended.  No bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  Extremities well perfused.  No edema.  Strong and symmetrical distal pulses.,A 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  No evidence of preexcitation.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Unremarkable.  No evidence of myocardial injury.  Thyroid function is pending.,Two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  Outpatient workup would be appropriate.  Event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  Suppressive medication (beta-blocker or Cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  The patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible.,Thank you for this consultation.  We will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  Caffeine avoidance was discussed as well.,ADDENDUM: , During her initial evaluation, a D-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  In addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.,",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

4867,A routine return appointment for a 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation.  Chief complaint today is shortness of breath.,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  This is a routine return appointment for this 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation.  Her chief complaint today is shortness of breath.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I last saw her in 09/2008.  Since then, she has been admitted to ABCD Hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode.  She was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation.  She was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her.  They wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one's great surprise.  My plan advent is to control her heart rate.  This has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid.  We will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation.  She may need to have a pacemaker placed and her AV node ablated if this does not work.,She notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights.  I think these are manifestations of heart failure.  She has peripheral edema.  She is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block.  I believe she takes her medications as directed, but I am never sure she actually is taking them correctly.  In any case, she did not bring her medications with her today.,Today, she had an ECG which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute.  There is a nonspecific IVCD.  This is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster.  In addition, I reviewed her echocardiogram done at XYZ.

4903,"Patient with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications, at least when I first saw him in the office on 01/11/06. He is now 77 years old. He is being seen on the Seventh Floor. The patient is in Room 7607. The patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. The workup began with GI bleeding. He was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. A nonocclusive DVT was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. Both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a Greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. Additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. The rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. The ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. The patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. The leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. The patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by Dr. R. He was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ACE inhibitors. The atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. As a matter of fact, they were discontinued. Now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia.,ALLERGIES:, THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,His diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet. He received his immunizations with flu in 2005 but did not receive Pneumovax.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient is married. He had 1 child who died at the age of 26 months of unknown etiology. He quit smoking 6 years ago but dips (smokeless) tobacco.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother had cancer, died at 70. Father died of unknown cause, and brother died of unknown cause.,FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY:, The patient is wheelchair bound at the time of his initial hospitalization. He is currently walking in the corridor with assistance.

Denies any psychiatric problems.,ENDOCRINE: Diabetes, NIDDM.,HEMATOLOGIC AND LYMPHATIC: The patient does not use any aspirin or anticoagulants and is not of anemia.,LABORATORY:, Current EKG demonstrates atrial fibrillation with incomplete left bundle branch block pattern. Q waves are noticed in the inferior leads. Nonprogression of the R-wave from V1 to V4 with small R-waves in V5 and V6 are suggestive of an old anterior and inferior infarcts. Left ventilator hypertrophy and strain is suspected.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: On exam, the patient is alert, oriented and cooperative. He is mildly pale. He is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus.,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular.

Pulses: Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally.,MEDICATIONS:, Current medications include enalapril, low dose enoxaparin, Fentanyl patches. He is no longer on fluconazole. He is on a sliding scale as per Dr. Holden. He is on lansoprazole (Prevacid), Toradol, piperacillin/tazobactam, hydralazine p.r.n., Zofran, Dilaudid, Benadryl, and Lopressor p.r.n.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:, The patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. His cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. He has chronic atrial fibrillation. I do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. He is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. Reason being is high likelihood for GI bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. At this point, I agree with the notion of hospice care. If his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, I would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right femoral region was infiltrated with subcutaneous lidocaine, adequate anesthesia was obtained.  The right femoral artery was entered with _______ modified Seldinger technique and a J wire was passed.  The needle was exchanged for 6 French sheath.  The wire was removed.  The sheath was washed with sterile saline.  Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed.  A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD.  The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro.  The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures.  The balloon was deflated and angiography demonstrated establishment of flow.  Following this, the lesion was stented with a 2.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent at 10 atmospheres.  The balloon was deflated, reinflated at 12 atmospheres, deflated and removed.  Final angiography demonstrated excellent clinical result.  Additional angiography was performed with a wire out.  Following this, the wire and the catheter was removed.  Following this, the right coronary was selectively cannulated with diagnostic catheter and angiographic views were obtained in multiple views.  This catheter was removed.  The pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle and left ventriculography was performed with pullback pressures across the aortic valve.  At the end of procedure, wires and catheter were removed.  Right femoral angiography was performed and a right femoral Angio-Seal kit was deployed at the right femoral arteriotomy site.

4912,Left heart cardiac catheterization.,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Right femoral artery access.,2.  Selective right and left coronary angiogram.,3.  Left heart catheterization.,4.  Left ventriculogram.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  A 50-year-old lady with known history of coronary artery disease with previous stenting to the left anterior descending artery presents with symptoms of shortness of breath.  The resting echocardiogram showed a severe decrease in her left ventricular systolic function with a reported LVEF of 20% to 25%.  This was a sharp decline from a previous LVEF of 50% to 55%.  We therefore, decided to proceed with coronary angiography.,TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in post-absorptive and non-sedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  2% Lidocaine was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery.  6-French JL4 and JR4 diagnostic catheters were used to perform the left and right coronary angiogram.  A 6-French pigtail catheter was used to perform the LV-gram in the RAO projection.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA: , LVEDP of 11.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,1.  The left main coronary artery is a very short vessel and immediately bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex coronary artery.,2.  The left main coronary artery is free of any disease.,3.  The left circumflex coronary artery which is a nondominant vessel gives off 2 marginal branches.  The first marginal branch is very small in caliber and runs a fairly long course and is free of any disease.,4.  The second marginal branch which is actually a continuation of the left circumflex coronary artery gives off several secondary branches.  One of its secondary branches which is a small caliber has an ostial 70% stenosis.,5.  The left anterior descending artery has a patent stent in the proximal LAD.  The second stent which is overlapping the junction of the mid and distal left anterior descending artery has mild late luminal loss.  There appears to be 30% narrowing involving the distal cuff segment of the stent in the distal left anterior descending artery.  The diagonal branches are free of any disease.,6.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel and has mild luminal irregularities.  Its midsegment has a focal area of 30% narrowing as well.  The rest of the right coronary artery is free of any disease.,7.  The LV-gram performed in the RAO projection shows well preserved left ventricular systolic function with an estimated LVEF of 55%.,RECOMMENDATION: , Continue with optimum medical therapy.  Because of the discrepancy between the left ventriculogram EF assessment and the echocardiographic EF assessment, I have discussed this matter with Dr. XYZ and we have decided to proceed with a repeat 2D echocardiogram.  The mild disease in the distal left anterior descending artery with mild in-stent re-stenosis should be managed medically with optimum control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

This morning, the patient developed worsening hypoxia with abundant sputum production requiring frequent suctioning from his ET tube.  The patient also had new-appearing atelectasis versus infiltrates in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest x-ray.  Given these findings, it was felt that bronchoscopy could further define source of secretions and send more appropriate specimen for culture if need be.,OPERATION:,  The patient was given additional fentanyl, Versed as well as paralytics for the procedure.  Small bronchoscope was inserted through the ET tube and to the trachea to the level of carina.  There was noted to be thick clear secretions adherent to the trachea walls as well as into the right mainstem bronchus.  Extensive secretions extended down into the secondary airways.  This was lavaged with saline and suctioned dry.  There is no overt specific occlusion of airways, nor was there any purulent-appearing sputum.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, and there was noted to be a small amount of similar-appearing secretions which was likewise suctioned and cleaned.

Left superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty.  ,4.  Left external iliac artery angioplasty.,5.  Left external iliac artery stent placement.,6.  Completion angiogram.,FINDINGS:  ,This patient was brought to the OR with a non-severe stenosis of the proximal left superficial femoral artery in the upper one-third of his thigh.  He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.,Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary.  However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery.  The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.  Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area.  Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result.  The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity.  We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.,The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.,A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh.  After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting.,The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion.,The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.,The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed.  We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.  We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.  A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.,We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery.  Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for.  Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area.  Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.  He had good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally on completion.  He was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

4971,A sample note on Angina.,"ANGINA, is chest pain due to a lack of oxygen to the heart most often occurring in men age 35 or older and postmenopausal women.  It is usually located right under the breast bone.  Physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on.  In a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled.  In a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn't get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles).  Other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia.  People more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.,*  The pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.,*  Possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.,*  Occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.,*  Pain may be located between the shoulder blades.,TREATMENT:,*  Nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds.  Carry it with you at all times.,*  Other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems.  It is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.,*  Surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.,*  Correct the contributing factors you have control over.  Lose weight, don't smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina.  Such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren't a risk).  Practice relaxation techniques.,*  Exercise! Discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.,*  Even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat.  Treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.,*  Let your doctor know if your angina doesn't go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet.  Call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps.  If your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

4998,"Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.","HISTORY: , A 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.",Allergy / Immunology
