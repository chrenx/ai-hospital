When I lived in Seattle, I used to have them too, but they seem even worse here for some reason. I tried taking Claritin and Zyrtec before because those worked at first but then stopped being effective over time. So last summer, I switched to Allegra, which started helping again two weeks ago. But now it's not doing much either. I've also used nasal sprays from the store, though no prescription ones yet. Oh, and by the way, I have asthma, but it hasn't been bothering me too much lately. As for medications, I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen right now, along with Allegra to help control my allergies."
